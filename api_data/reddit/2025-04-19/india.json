    "content": "I am 26 years old and have an elder sister who is 28. We come from a lower caste, and throughout my life, people have constantly reminded us of that. Because of this, I ended up hiding my caste. I was in a relationship for over four years, but things went wrong and we broke up.\n\nWe are a family of four. Both my parents work in respectable government jobs, and we now belong to the upper-middle class. However, many of our relatives still live in poverty. I completed my MBA this year, and by next month, I\u2019ll be starting a well-paying job.\n\nMy parents are struggling to find a suitable groom for my sister. Most of the matches we've come across are from villages or hold backward mindsets. She has met around 11\u201312 potential matches through arranged setups, but none have worked out. She is also in a relationship, but her boyfriend is from a different caste, and his family will not accept us.\n\nNow I\u2019m anxious about my own future. How will I find a good husband? Where should I place my hopes?\n\nHaving been in a long-term relationship, I now have a few non-negotiables in my list. But even if I compromise on those, I still worry that I won\u2019t find the right person.\n\nWhat should I do?"

    "content": "In roles like scientists, doctors, engineers, and other professional positions, prioritizing meritocracy versus caste-based reservations involves weighing technical competence against social equity. These roles demand high skill, precision, and accountability, directly impacting public safety, innovation, and economic outcomes. Here\u2019s a concise analysis of what should take precedence, grounded in evidence and reasoning.\n\nCase for Prioritizing Meritocracy:\n1. **Critical Competence**:\n   - **Scientists**: Breakthroughs in fields like physics or AI require deep expertise, often measurable through rigorous exams or research output. Lower entry standards (e.g., 30-40/100 vs. 70/100) risk selecting candidates unprepared for cutting-edge work.\n   - **Doctors**: Medical errors can be fatal. A 2018 study on NEET (medical entrance exam) showed reserved candidates with lower scores needed more remedial training to match peers, raising concerns about initial competence in high-stakes roles like surgery.\n   - **Engineers**: Infrastructure or tech failures (e.g., bridge collapses, software bugs) can cost lives or billions. IIT admission data shows reserved candidates often score 20-30% lower, potentially affecting readiness for complex projects without extensive support.\n\n2. **Public Safety and Trust**:\n   - Professions like medicine and engineering directly affect lives. Public trust hinges on perceived competence. If reservations lead to visibly underqualified hires, it fuels skepticism, as seen in X posts where users question reserved doctors\u2019 capabilities.\n   - Example: A 2016 survey found 55% of patients preferred doctors selected purely on merit, citing confidence in outcomes.\n\n3. **Global Competitiveness**:\n   - India\u2019s tech and science sectors compete globally. Companies like ISRO or Infosys rely on top talent to rival NASA or Google. A 2020 NASSCOM report emphasized merit-based hiring as key to India\u2019s IT edge, where caste-based quotas could dilute quality.\n   - China\u2019s merit-driven system, producing high-caliber scientists and engineers, is often cited on X as a contrast to India\u2019s quota model, correlating with its technological lead.\n\n4. **Long-Term Efficiency**:\n   - While training can bridge gaps, the time and cost of upskilling lower-scoring candidates strain resources, especially in fast-paced fields. A 2019 study on public sector engineers found reserved hires took 1-2 years longer to match unreserved peers\u2019 productivity.\n\n### Case for Prioritizing Caste-Based Reservations:\n1. **Historical Equity**:\n   - SCs/STs/OBCs, ~50% of India\u2019s population, faced centuries of exclusion from education and professional roles. Without reservations, their representation in elite fields would be negligible (e.g., pre-quota IITs had <5% SC/ST students). Reservations ensure access to roles historically dominated by upper castes.\n   - Example: By 2020, SC/ST doctors in government hospitals rose to ~15%, aligning closer to their 25% population share, due to quotas.\n\n2. **Diversity Benefits**:\n   - Diverse teams enhance innovation and empathy. A 2020 McKinsey study found companies with diverse leadership were 25% more likely to innovate. Reserved professionals bring unique perspectives, especially in medicine, where SC/ST doctors may better understand marginalized patients\u2019 needs.\n   - Example: Reserved scientists from underrepresented groups have contributed to ISRO missions, showing quotas don\u2019t always compromise quality.\n\n3. **Systemic Barriers**:\n   - SC/ST/OBC candidates often face inferior schooling, limited coaching, and economic hardship. A 2018 NSSO survey showed only 12% of SC households access private tutoring vs. 25% for upper castes. Lower exam cutoffs (e.g., 30-40/100) compensate for these disparities, not inherent ability.\n   - With training, reserved candidates often excel. A 2016 IIM study found SC/ST students admitted with lower scores matched peers in placements after coursework.\n\n4. **Social Stability**:\n   - Excluding marginalized groups from high-status roles risks unrest. Reservations reduce caste tensions by ensuring representation, as seen in the rise of SC/ST professionals in bureaucracy and academia.\n\n### Balancing the Two:\n- **Meritocracy\u2019s Edge in High-Stakes Roles**: For scientists, doctors, and engineers, meritocracy should take priority due to the immediate risks of underperformance (e.g., medical errors, engineering failures) and the need for global competitiveness. A surgeon or rocket scientist with a 30/100 score, even with training, may struggle in roles requiring instant expertise.\n- **Reservations\u2019 Role in Equity**: However, completely ignoring reservations perpetuates exclusion. SC/ST/OBC underrepresentation in elite fields (e.g., only 10% of private sector tech roles) reflects ongoing barriers. Reservations can ensure access but should be paired with robust mechanisms to maintain quality.\n\n### Recommended Approach:\n1. **Merit-Based Selection with Support**:\n   - Use high but fair cutoffs for all, supplemented by pre-qualification programs (e.g., free coaching, scholarships) to help SC/ST/OBC candidates compete. For instance, IITs\u2019 preparatory courses for reserved students have boosted pass rates without lowering standards.\n   - Example: ISRO\u2019s merit-focused hiring, combined with outreach to diverse talent, balances quality and inclusion.\n\n2. **Training and Mentorship**:\n   - Post-selection training (e.g., medical residencies, engineering apprenticeships) can bridge gaps for reserved candidates, ensuring they meet professional standards. UPSC\u2019s training model, where reserved IAS officers excel post-induction, is a success case.\n\n3. **Limited Quotas in Critical Roles**:\n   - Cap reservations in high-stakes fields (e.g., 10-15% vs. 50%) to prioritize competence while ensuring some diversity. South Africa\u2019s affirmative action in medicine uses similar caps to balance equity and quality.\n\n4. **Economic-Based Supplements**:\n   - Add income-based quotas (like EWS) to support poor unreserved candidates, reducing resentment and broadening upliftment without diluting merit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn roles like scientists, doctors, and engineers, **meritocracy should be prioritized** due to the need for technical excellence, public safety, and global competitiveness. Caste-based reservations, while critical for equity and diversity, risk compromising quality if cutoffs are too low (e.g., 30-40/100 vs. 70/100). A balanced approach\u2014high merit standards, pre-qualification support, robust training, and limited quotas\u2014can uphold competence while addressing historical inequities. This ensures professionals are both skilled and representative, avoiding the pitfalls of either extreme."

From what I saw, I don't think there was a collision, but the boy lost control and fell. The guy who caused it fled the scene immediately\n \nPeople nearby rushed in to help, and the boy went unconscious. I know it's not always the right move to nterfere physically in such situations, especially without proper training, because sometimes it can cause more harm than good. Everyone around was trying to help in their own way. Some were attempting to unlock his phone to reach his parents or friends. I wasn't sure what else to do, but I felt I had to act. So, i searched google for ambulance number and for the first time in my life, I called 108.\n \nTo be honest, I used to think services like 108 were just for show. But the person on the line took the details seriously, and within 10 minutes, an ambulance was arranged. The driver even called me to coordinate.

    "content": "As a North Indian, I\u2019ve been observing the ongoing debate about language imposition\u2014especially the fear around Hindi being forced in South India. So I decided to read and understand what our Constitution actually says. And here\u2019s what I found, along with what I personally believe\n\nArticle 345 \u2013 States can adopt any language in use as their official language.\n\nThis gives every state the power to declare its own language\u2014like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam\u2014as official. So if the Centre tries to impose a common language like Hindi, it goes against the federal spirit of this Article.\n\n\nArticle 351 \u2013 The Union should promote Hindi, but without hurting other languages.\n\nThis means Hindi can be promoted, but not in a way that makes other languages feel inferior. That\u2019s where the real tension begins\u2014when promotion feels like replacement.\n\n\nArticle 347 \u2013 If a large group of people speaks a language, they can ask the President for recognition.\n\nMost South Indian languages are already recognized, but still, there's fear. And honestly\u2014I get it.\n\n\nWhy the Fear Is Valid\n\nI agree that Hindi is spoken by 43.7% of Indians. That's a huge percentage. Compared to that, the percentage of Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, or Malayalam speakers is smaller.\n\nSo I completely understand why people from South India might feel insecure. It\u2019s not just about language\u2014it\u2019s about cultural identity, respect, and representation. If Hindi keeps growing in influence\u2014through school syllabuses, government exams, national broadcasts\u2014it may slowly push regional languages to the side. And that\u2019s a valid fear.\n\n\nMy Perspective as a North Indian\n\nBeing from a Hindi-speaking region, I see Hindi everywhere\u2014in schools, in media, in everyday life. But does that mean others should have to give up or bend to our language? Absolutely not.\n\nIn fact, if we expect others to learn Hindi, why don\u2019t we learn their languages too?\n\nLanguages like Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Telugu are beautiful and ancient. So why aren\u2019t they taught in North Indian schools\u2014even as optional subjects?\n\n\nWhat Can Be Done (By People + Government)\n\n1. Freedom to Choose \u2013 Let students pick Hindi or English as their second language.\n\n\n2. Two-Way Language Learning \u2013 Encourage North Indians to learn South Indian languages too.\n\n\n3. Cultural Respect > Political Power \u2013 Promote diversity, not dominance.\n\n\n4. More South Indian Language Visibility \u2013 In media, government programs, and education.\n\n\nUnity doesn't mean making everyone speak the same language. It means giving space to every language to grow and flourish. We can only become a stronger India when every Indian feels respected\u2014linguistically, culturally, emotionally.\n\nAs a humanities student, I\u2019ve read about these\n concepts in the Constitution, which is why I feel it\u2019s important to approach this debate with understanding and respect for all languages.\n\nDisclaimer: These are purely my personal thoughts and observations. I\u2019m not trying to impose any opinion on anyone\u2014just sharing what I feel after reading, thinking, and listening to both sides of the debate."

They put allegations on me for unpaid EMI on some phone and the loan is linked to someone named Arjun from UP. \n\nMy name is not Arjun and neither do I live in UP. They are extremely rude and start misbehaving when I tell them I am not Arjun and I haven't taken any loan. They accuse me of fraud and ask me how did I get this phone number when this phone number belongs to Arjun.\n\nI talk to them nicely trying to get them to delete my number from the database but they never listen and just keep misbehaving more and more until I have no choice but to hang up. And when I say misbehave, they really go to all extents. \n\nI wanted to see if anyone else has been harassed by repeated calls like this and how did you get out of this mess. I don't know how many more numbers I can block as they call me 20 times from different numbers everyday. \n\nI tried talking to DMI finance customer care, they asked me to share my aadhar and pan card so they can verify my identity. I obviously didn't send them any documents as it clearly didn't feel safe. I threatened them with a consumer court complaint after which they said they'll try and remove my number but nothing ever happened. \n\nLet this be a lesson for everyone, keep your phone number private and don't give it out unnecessarily, everyone is selling your data. And don't do business with shady companies like DMI finance."

The job was a online work that I will need to do but I needed to visit the agency to register. \n\n\nI visited and asked details about job and everything which they clarified there and they claimed that I will be hired from tomorrow morning.\nAnd next morning the manager of agency messaged me that I need to pay 4500 Ruppee extra which wasn't mentioned nor have been told about in any agreement not even in there advertisement.\nThey daily call me and say that I will need to pay this amount for software and some training practice. I always confront him that as being a student, I can't simply pay this sum of money in just a day and also states that this wasn't written on the agreement that I signed for which he completely dodge or ignore whenever confronted.\n\n\nLater I searched very deeply online about the agency and i found that this same agency name with same GSTIN is in other state and on Justdial website there is a single comment for that other branch that they charge 1500 and then charge another 4500 out of surprise and give a job online which actually create online advertisement to lure youngsters and student in the name of part time job. They never actually pay anyone and leave the applicant after some time in ignorance and block them. This agency has been doing this from years around other states too with all of there other branches. Creating a network of scam to lure youngsters ans students.\n\nThen 3 days later he started to put pressure on me that if I don't pay, i will need to pay the 1500 sum again as it will expire.\n\nI felt very pressured and i wrote a letter with all attached documents like call recording and every evidence I had against him and filed it to cyber police as it felt like mental harassment. They simply don't care if I am student or not, they just want the money anyhow.\n\nI first wanted to report this to the police in local area but the fact that there are 4 police station around 3km radius of that scam agency and they are very confident in exploiting youth/student this openly put my faint in my local police down. I can not believe they are doing this, this open and wide in such area. \n\nEven though I have filed this on cybercrime mail and website and even NHC (I filed there first because they refused for the 1500 refund and I was unaware of the scam network of the company that time). I feel scared since they have my partial address, name, phone number, whatsapp number and Aadhar number, they don't have my photo. But these given information are already very much that he have about me. And knowing that even 4 police station surrounding the scam center are simply unaware, I feel unsafe about it."

She has dual cancer, (Lungs and ovarian) there may be more but the biopsy is not done yet. They have found tumour in my mother's lungs which needs to be done ASAP, it's getting close to her heart that's why she can't breathe right now.\n\nMy mother is very serious rn, she is having chest pain, she can't speak and hardly breathe, and can't walk properly. Father is alcoholic and abusive, didn't even ask what she is diagnosed with, he doesn't care about us and ignore us. My mother is the one who raised us from the very start, by doing 10 hours petrol pump job where she used to stand all day long since they didn't allow the workers to sit. I can't manage to lose her since she never saw Happy days from her childhood and I don't want her to die before seeing those days.\n\nWe took her to GTB and Lok nayak in emergency but they denied taking her into emergency. Safdarjung didn't pay enough attention to her in emergency, they just injected some pain relief liquid that didn't even help at all. AIIMS, RGCI, TATA memorial might be the only option who could perform the surgery, but the surgery needs to be done asap. RGCI is a private hospital might take a lot of cost, and TATA memorial is free but we are from Delhi and the accomodations will be too high for us to bear. I tried making ayushman card but it not available for delhi residents. We don't have BPL and Ration card. AIIMS will take a lot of time due to very high waiting line. If any of you know some organisations or anyone who is in touch with someone from AIIMS, please help. If you could help us in anything, we would be very grateful to you till death. \nThankyou \nEdit: My username is partypooper _06, I have tweeted this on twitter, please get me reach there."

That\u2019s when he opened up and shared his story with me.\n\nHe recently got married\u2014just three months ago\u2014to his girlfriend. Both are 27 years old and from different castes. His family opposed the marriage, and her family, especially her father (who is quite wealthy), wanted her to marry a rich doctor. She is a physiotherapist, and he works in IT.\n\nThey were living in Walajah, away from Chennai, until recently. Her father managed to use his influence\u2014possibly by bribing police\u2014and sent two policemen to their place, saying they just needed to visit the Chennai police station to sign some documents. Since they are adults and married with consent, they didn\u2019t expect anything serious.\n\nBut once they reached the police station, they were separated. The guy was humiliated, his phone, wallet, and photos were taken, and he was threatened to return to his hometown. None of his family or friends are supporting him. His wife was taken away by her family, despite crying and protesting. (He also mentioned she is pregnant, but her family doesn\u2019t know yet.)\n\nNow, he\u2019s completely hopeless. He has little to no money. The police have asked him to come again to Chennai with all the documents related to their marriage and also to resolve some minor issue involving his ex-girlfriend (he claims it\u2019s nothing serious, just something the police dug up).\n\nHe fears that if his wife stays at her parents\u2019 house for two months, they might forcefully marry her off to someone else or brainwash her.\n\nHe wants to hire a good lawyer to help them reunite, but he has no idea how to go about it.\n\nCan someone please help or guide me on what can be done legally so that:\n\n1. They can meet or talk again.\n2. She is not forcibly married off.\n3. They are protected from harassment by police or her family.\n4. He can take legal action to live with his wife peacefully.\nAny help or legal advice would be deeply appreciated."

But zoom out, and you start seeing something deeper\u2014a system that thrives on unpredictability.\n\nThe Real MVPs: Betting & Fantasy Apps\nApps like Dream11, My11Circle, and others have been aggressively promoted\u2014through ads, players, influencers, even inside JioCinema. They\u2019re framed as \"skill-based\" games, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014they function like betting platforms.\n\nWhen a match flips:\n\nOdds swing wildly.\n\nPeople switch bets mid-match.\n\nVolume goes up, and platforms rake in more cash.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the cricket anymore. It\u2019s about who can milk the chaos best.\n\nThe Word-of-Mouth Hype Machine\nWhat really fuels the system is mouth publicity. Everyone knows someone who says:\n\n\u201cBro, if I had just bet \u20b91 on Punjab yesterday, I\u2019d have gotten \u20b91,000.\u201d\n\nThis kind of talk spreads like wildfire. It triggers FOMO, greed, and gets more people on the apps. The platforms don\u2019t even need to advertise anymore\u2014the users do it for them.\n\nAnd the Government? They're Not Losing Either.\nEvery transaction on these apps:\n\nPays GST or platform fees.\n\nApplies TDS on winnings.\n\nGenerates digital payment data and tax revenue.\n\nSo technically, the government isn\u2019t against it\u2014it\u2019s benefiting quietly while the apps grow bigger every season.\n\nSo What\u2019s Really Happening?\nHere\u2019s the full cycle:\n\nIPL delivers unpredictable matches that feel scripted for drama.\n\nFantasy and betting apps capitalize on emotional engagement.\n\nSocial media and peer hype pull more people in.\n\nEveryone from BCCI to the government profits.\n\nThe only ones losing are the majority of fans who keep betting, thinking they\u2019re the next genius to beat the odds.\n\nEdit :- My rage bait worked...the amount of people that got rattled by this post is hilarious...they're really defending cricket as if its actually a religion\nJoke's on all of you emotional fools"
