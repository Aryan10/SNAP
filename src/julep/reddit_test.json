    "content": "I am 26 years old and have an elder sister who is 28. We come from a lower caste, and throughout my life, people have constantly reminded us of that. Because of this, I ended up hiding my caste. I was in a relationship for over four years, but things went wrong and we broke up.\n\nWe are a family of four. Both my parents work in respectable government jobs, and we now belong to the upper-middle class. However, many of our relatives still live in poverty. I completed my MBA this year, and by next month, I\u2019ll be starting a well-paying job.\n\nMy parents are struggling to find a suitable groom for my sister. Most of the matches we've come across are from villages or hold backward mindsets. She has met around 11\u201312 potential matches through arranged setups, but none have worked out. She is also in a relationship, but her boyfriend is from a different caste, and his family will not accept us.\n\nNow I\u2019m anxious about my own future. How will I find a good husband? Where should I place my hopes?\n\nHaving been in a long-term relationship, I now have a few non-negotiables in my list. But even if I compromise on those, I still worry that I won\u2019t find the right person.\n\nWhat should I do?"

    "content": "In roles like scientists, doctors, engineers, and other professional positions, prioritizing meritocracy versus caste-based reservations involves weighing technical competence against social equity. These roles demand high skill, precision, and accountability, directly impacting public safety, innovation, and economic outcomes. Here\u2019s a concise analysis of what should take precedence, grounded in evidence and reasoning.\n\nCase for Prioritizing Meritocracy:\n1. **Critical Competence**:\n   - **Scientists**: Breakthroughs in fields like physics or AI require deep expertise, often measurable through rigorous exams or research output. Lower entry standards (e.g., 30-40/100 vs. 70/100) risk selecting candidates unprepared for cutting-edge work.\n   - **Doctors**: Medical errors can be fatal. A 2018 study on NEET (medical entrance exam) showed reserved candidates with lower scores needed more remedial training to match peers, raising concerns about initial competence in high-stakes roles like surgery.\n   - **Engineers**: Infrastructure or tech failures (e.g., bridge collapses, software bugs) can cost lives or billions. IIT admission data shows reserved candidates often score 20-30% lower, potentially affecting readiness for complex projects without extensive support.\n\n2. **Public Safety and Trust**:\n   - Professions like medicine and engineering directly affect lives. Public trust hinges on perceived competence. If reservations lead to visibly underqualified hires, it fuels skepticism, as seen in X posts where users question reserved doctors\u2019 capabilities.\n   - Example: A 2016 survey found 55% of patients preferred doctors selected purely on merit, citing confidence in outcomes.\n\n3. **Global Competitiveness**:\n   - India\u2019s tech and science sectors compete globally. Companies like ISRO or Infosys rely on top talent to rival NASA or Google. A 2020 NASSCOM report emphasized merit-based hiring as key to India\u2019s IT edge, where caste-based quotas could dilute quality.\n   - China\u2019s merit-driven system, producing high-caliber scientists and engineers, is often cited on X as a contrast to India\u2019s quota model, correlating with its technological lead.\n\n4. **Long-Term Efficiency**:\n   - While training can bridge gaps, the time and cost of upskilling lower-scoring candidates strain resources, especially in fast-paced fields. A 2019 study on public sector engineers found reserved hires took 1-2 years longer to match unreserved peers\u2019 productivity.\n\n### Case for Prioritizing Caste-Based Reservations:\n1. **Historical Equity**:\n   - SCs/STs/OBCs, ~50% of India\u2019s population, faced centuries of exclusion from education and professional roles. Without reservations, their representation in elite fields would be negligible (e.g., pre-quota IITs had <5% SC/ST students). Reservations ensure access to roles historically dominated by upper castes.\n   - Example: By 2020, SC/ST doctors in government hospitals rose to ~15%, aligning closer to their 25% population share, due to quotas.\n\n2. **Diversity Benefits**:\n   - Diverse teams enhance innovation and empathy. A 2020 McKinsey study found companies with diverse leadership were 25% more likely to innovate. Reserved professionals bring unique perspectives, especially in medicine, where SC/ST doctors may better understand marginalized patients\u2019 needs.\n   - Example: Reserved scientists from underrepresented groups have contributed to ISRO missions, showing quotas don\u2019t always compromise quality.\n\n3. **Systemic Barriers**:\n   - SC/ST/OBC candidates often face inferior schooling, limited coaching, and economic hardship. A 2018 NSSO survey showed only 12% of SC households access private tutoring vs. 25% for upper castes. Lower exam cutoffs (e.g., 30-40/100) compensate for these disparities, not inherent ability.\n   - With training, reserved candidates often excel. A 2016 IIM study found SC/ST students admitted with lower scores matched peers in placements after coursework.\n\n4. **Social Stability**:\n   - Excluding marginalized groups from high-status roles risks unrest. Reservations reduce caste tensions by ensuring representation, as seen in the rise of SC/ST professionals in bureaucracy and academia.\n\n### Balancing the Two:\n- **Meritocracy\u2019s Edge in High-Stakes Roles**: For scientists, doctors, and engineers, meritocracy should take priority due to the immediate risks of underperformance (e.g., medical errors, engineering failures) and the need for global competitiveness. A surgeon or rocket scientist with a 30/100 score, even with training, may struggle in roles requiring instant expertise.\n- **Reservations\u2019 Role in Equity**: However, completely ignoring reservations perpetuates exclusion. SC/ST/OBC underrepresentation in elite fields (e.g., only 10% of private sector tech roles) reflects ongoing barriers. Reservations can ensure access but should be paired with robust mechanisms to maintain quality.\n\n### Recommended Approach:\n1. **Merit-Based Selection with Support**:\n   - Use high but fair cutoffs for all, supplemented by pre-qualification programs (e.g., free coaching, scholarships) to help SC/ST/OBC candidates compete. For instance, IITs\u2019 preparatory courses for reserved students have boosted pass rates without lowering standards.\n   - Example: ISRO\u2019s merit-focused hiring, combined with outreach to diverse talent, balances quality and inclusion.\n\n2. **Training and Mentorship**:\n   - Post-selection training (e.g., medical residencies, engineering apprenticeships) can bridge gaps for reserved candidates, ensuring they meet professional standards. UPSC\u2019s training model, where reserved IAS officers excel post-induction, is a success case.\n\n3. **Limited Quotas in Critical Roles**:\n   - Cap reservations in high-stakes fields (e.g., 10-15% vs. 50%) to prioritize competence while ensuring some diversity. South Africa\u2019s affirmative action in medicine uses similar caps to balance equity and quality.\n\n4. **Economic-Based Supplements**:\n   - Add income-based quotas (like EWS) to support poor unreserved candidates, reducing resentment and broadening upliftment without diluting merit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn roles like scientists, doctors, and engineers, **meritocracy should be prioritized** due to the need for technical excellence, public safety, and global competitiveness. Caste-based reservations, while critical for equity and diversity, risk compromising quality if cutoffs are too low (e.g., 30-40/100 vs. 70/100). A balanced approach\u2014high merit standards, pre-qualification support, robust training, and limited quotas\u2014can uphold competence while addressing historical inequities. This ensures professionals are both skilled and representative, avoiding the pitfalls of either extreme."

Combine this with the rise in untraceable transactions (crypto, UPI tricks, and laundering methods) and it starts to form a sick pattern.\n\nWhat if these brutal crimes are being filmed and sold?\nWhat if the violence isn't just a side effect but the product itself?\n\nThis needs to be talked about. If there\u2019s a network profiting from real abuse videos, then we\u2019re not just dealing with criminals, we're dealing with a market that rewards horror.\n\nHas anyone else thought about this?\n\nAre there any data or reports that go deeper into this possible link between brutal sexual violence and dark web trade?"

    "content": "I was visiting Thanjavur and Kumbakonam, and around 9 PM, I was walking from the Thanjavur Periya Kovil to the Old Bus Stand. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise from pehind. It was from scooters. An accident had just happened. A guy on a scooter was riding on the wrong side, and while trying to avoid him, another boy, probably in his teenage years, ended up getting into an accident. From what I saw, I don't think there was a collision, but the boy lost control and fell. The guy who caused it fled the scene immediately\n \nPeople nearby rushed in to help, and the boy went unconscious. I know it's not always the right move to nterfere physically in such situations, especially without proper training, because sometimes it can cause more harm than good. Everyone around was trying to help in their own way. Some were attempting to unlock his phone to reach his parents or friends. I wasn't sure what else to do, but I felt I had to act. So, i searched google for ambulance number and for the first time in my life, I called 108.\n \nTo be honest, I used to think services like 108 were just for show. But the person on the line took the details seriously, and within 10 minutes, an ambulance was arranged. The driver even called me to coordinate. When i talking to ambulancedriver, a group of his friends, a bunch of teenagers arrived. Even though the boy was still not fully conscious, they lifted him and took him away on a scooter. I don't know where they were headed. I told this to driver and he told me call 108 inform them to cancel ambulance, I called 108 again and cancelled the ambulance.\n \nI'm sharing this here to spread some awareness, especially for people like me who didn't know how real and responsive 108 can be. In this case, I wasn't able to do much, but I've realized that everyone can do something. Our government system isn't as bad as we often think. Sometimes, it just takes someone to act.\n\nI hope that boy is okay."
