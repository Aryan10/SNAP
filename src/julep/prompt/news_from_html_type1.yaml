      - summary (max 100 words)
      - content (text-only, preserve paragraphs, keep it decently lengthy)
      - category (World, Business, Technology, Entertainment, Sports, Science, Health)
      - tags (array of relevant keywords e.g. politics, economy, technology, etc.)
      - location (string, guessed from content â€” should be either a country, city, or region; use "unknown" if not inferable)
      Must escape double quotes to ensure JSON::parse.
      The output must resemble a json file and must not start with "I will/have done this"
