  "content": "Indian airport operators are pushing for liberalization of the country's aviation policies, specifically calling for reduced restrictions on international carriers. The airports argue that the current protectionist stance limits growth potential and connectivity options.\n\nThe move comes as airports seek to increase international traffic and optimize their infrastructure usage. They suggest that allowing international carriers more operational freedom would benefit both the aviation sector and travelers through increased competition and better connectivity options.\n\nCurrent regulations restrict foreign carriers' access to Indian routes and airports, a policy that has long been criticized by industry stakeholders for limiting the country's aviation growth potential.",
