This marks a significant milestone in DeepTek\u2019s commitment to delivering safe, effective, and scalable AI tools to transform diagnostic radiology worldwide.\n\nThe Chest X-ray AI solution is designed to assist physicians in interpreting frontal chest X-rays (AP/PA views). Powered by advanced machine learning, the solution detects a host of lung conditions such as nodules, lung masses, tuberculosis, pneumothorax, and over 20 other findings, including rib and clavicular fractures.\n\nIn addition, the solution identifies multiple medical devices commonly encountered in inpatient and ICU settings, such as chest leads, pacemakers, and various tubes, providing critical support in complex clinical scenarios.\n\nA unique feature of this solution is its ability to interpret pediatric chest X-rays, including the detection of pediatric tuberculosis and pneumonia, enhancing diagnostic capabilities in younger populations\u2014a segment often underserved by conventional AI models.\n\n\u201cThis CE MDR Class IIb certification reflects our deep commitment to clinical excellence and patient safety,\u201dsaid Dr Amit Kharat, Co-Founder of DeepTek. \u201cOur Chest X-ray AI solution acts as a concurrent reading aid, highlighting regions of suspicion to improve radiologist efficiency and diagnostic confidence.\u201d\n\nThe certification enables DeepTek to expand the availability of its solution across Europe and other CE\n\n-mark recognized regions, offering a powerful tool to enhance productivity, reduce diagnostic delays, and support quality care delivery at scale\n\nWith this regulatory clearance for TB and other critical lung conditions, DeepTek\u2019s AI-powered Chest X-ray solution is a trusted and clinically validated tool used across public health screening and hospital workflows. Additionally, it is among the few solutions to have received comprehensive US FDA CADe approval, further reinforcing its reliability and clinical rigor in medical imaging applications.\n\nThe need for such solutions is particularly urgent in regions grappling with a high TB burden and limited access to expert radiology. With a staggering TB burden and growing radiology workload, CE certification paves the way for deployment across Europe, Asia, Africa, and other CE-mark-recognized regions where\n\nAI-driven diagnostics are not just valuable\u2014but vital. This milestone is not just about regulatory success\u2014it\u2019s about saving lives through early detection and bridging gaps in healthcare access.\n\nDeepTek\u2019s Chest X-ray AI solution is already making a meaningful impact, having screened over 2 million people for TB. The solution is deployed across 325 sites for TB screening, supporting national TB programs and public health initiatives across multiple geographies.\n\nAbout DeepTek\n\nFounded in 2017, DeepTek is a US-incorporated radiology AI company with a global footprint and a mission to democratize expert radiology access. With deployments across 1,200+ sites and over 3,000 studies processed daily, DeepTek\u2019s US FDA-cleared and CE-certified solutions empower radiologists and healthcare providers to deliver faster, more accurate diagnoses.\n\nCXOtoday is a premier resource on the world of IT, relevant to key business decision makers.
