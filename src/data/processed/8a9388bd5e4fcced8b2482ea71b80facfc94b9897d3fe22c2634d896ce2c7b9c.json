  "summary": "Cambridge University researchers have discovered compelling evidence suggesting possible life on exoplanet K2-18b using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. The team detected life-associated molecules like dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide in the planet's atmosphere, marking a significant breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.",
  "content": "In a major scientific development, researchers at Cambridge University have found compelling, though not yet confirmed, evidence pointing to the possible presence of life on a distant exoplanet named K2-18b. Utilizing NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the team detected atmospheric molecules.\n\nIn a groundbreaking development, scientists from Cambridge University have found the most promising evidence yet that life may exist beyond Earth. Their research, using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), identified life-associated molecules like dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS) in the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet named K2-18b. Although these findings are not yet confirmed at the highest scientific certainty, they represent a crucial step in the search for extraterrestrial life and open new frontiers in astrobiology.",
