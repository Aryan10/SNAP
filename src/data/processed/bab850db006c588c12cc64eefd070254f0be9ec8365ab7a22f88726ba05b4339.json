  "summary": "An Indian tech worker successfully navigated from H1B visa to B2 tourist visa following layoff in December 2024. The change of status was approved within 60 days, demonstrating a feasible path for laid-off H1B holders despite immigration uncertainties. The case highlights both possibilities and challenges in the current U.S. immigration system.",
  "content": "In December 2024, hundreds of thousands of Indian technology employees in the United States faced the axe of layoff. For H1B visa holders, it wasn't merely losing employment\u2014it meant a countdown to return home unless they managed to secure a chance to remain.\n\nOne popular route is going from H1B to a B2 tourist visa, only to stall. But that path is uncertain, particularly under new America, with an evolving immigration agenda.\n\nThat's what exactly transpired with one Indian employee. Following a layoff in December, they sought a B2 change of status (COS) in February 2025\u2014and were approved early in April, all within 60 days.\n\nThere were legitimate concerns that the B2 application could be delayed or denied. A lot of people in the community are suspicious of this option, largely because it isn't always obvious how USCIS looks at such transitions.\n\nIn this instance, there were no RFEs (Requests for Evidence) issued on any of the petitions\u2014the B2 COS and new H1B transfer were seamless. That does not happen very often, and perhaps just plain good fortune, but it illustrates this path is feasible.\n\nPeople often talk about backup plans, but rarely about the mental toll of living in legal limbo. It's stressful not knowing if you'll have to uproot your life and leave the country you've called home for years.\n\nThere's a need for clearer communication around visa options post-layoff. Right now, too many people rely on forums, rumors, and scattered advice to make life-changing decisions.\n\nStories like this one give some hope, but also highlight the gaps in the system. Stability shouldn't depend on luck\u2014it should be built into the process.",
