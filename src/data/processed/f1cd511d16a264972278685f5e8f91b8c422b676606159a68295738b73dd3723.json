  "summary": "Astrophysicists from ARIES have detected an intermediate black hole in galaxy NGC 4395, located 4.3 million light-years from Earth. Using India's largest optical telescope, they found gas clouds orbiting the black hole at 545 km/s. The black hole weighs 22,000 times the Sun's mass and consumes matter at 6% of its maximum theoretical rate.",

However, their faint nature and location in small galaxies make them extremely difficult to observe.\n\nUnlike their larger counterparts, they don\u2019t generate bright emissions unless they\u2019re actively pulling in matter, making advanced observational techniques essential.\n\nThe team of astrophysicists, led by Shivangi Pandey studied NGC 4395 -- a low-luminosity active galaxy hosting one of the faintest actively feeding black holes ever observed.\n\nThey used the 3.6m DOT, and its indigenously developed spectrograph and camera ADFOSC, along with the smaller 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) located at the Devasthal Observatory of ARIES in Uttarakhand\u2019s Nainital.\n\nThe team monitored the object continuously for two nights using both telescopes and applied a special technique called spectrophotometric reverberation mapping.\n\nThis technique measures the delay between light emitted by the black hole's accretion disk and the surrounding gas clouds (broad-line region). This delay, or time lag, revealed the region's size and helped calculate the black hole\u2019s mass, said the team.\n\nThe results, published in the Astrophysical Journal, showed that \u201cthe IMBH weighs about 22,000 times the Sun's mass, making it one of the most precisely measured intermediate-mass black holes. The black hole consumes matter at just 6 per cent of its maximum theoretical rate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe hunt for more IMBHs is far from over. Larger telescopes and advanced instruments will be key to uncovering these cosmic middleweights,\u201d said Dr Suvendu Rakshit, a scientist at ARIES.\n\n(IANS)\n\nJoin and get latest news updates delivered to you via WhatsApp\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter!"
