The study found moderate reductions in blood pressure through methods like breathing control, meditation, mindfulness, and music therapy. However, these effects tend to diminish over time.",

        "content": "HealthDay News\u2014Relaxation and stress management techniques have short-term beneficial effects for people with hypertension, according to a systematic review and network meta-analysis published online April 7 inBMJ Medicine.\n\nKatie E. Webster, B.M., B.Ch., D.Phil., from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, and colleagues conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to examine whether relaxation and stress management techniques are useful for reducing blood pressure in hypertension (blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm Hg) and prehypertension (blood pressure \u2265120/80 mm Hg). Data were included for 182 studies: 166 for hypertension and 16 for prehypertension.\n\nThe researchers found that most relaxation interventions seemed to have a beneficial effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure at short-term follow-up (\u22643 months) for individuals withhypertension. Moderate between-study heterogeneity was seen. Moderate reductions in systolic blood pressure were seen forbreathingcontrol, meditation, meditative movement, mindfulness, music, progressive muscle relaxation, psychotherapy, and multicomponent interventions compared with a passive comparator (mean differences, \u20136.65, \u20137.71, \u20139.58, \u20139.90, \u20136.61, \u20137.46, \u20139.83, and \u20136.78 mm Hg, respectively). There were also reductions in diastolic blood pressure. The effects on blood pressure seemed to lessen over time, although few studies conducted follow-up for more than three months. Limited data were available for prehypertension, with small effects on systolic blood pressure for short-term follow-up comparing the effects of relaxation therapies with a passive comparator (mean difference, \u20133.84 mm Hg for meditative movement and \u20130.53 mm Hg for a multicomponent intervention).\n\n\u201cThe results of our study indicated that many relaxation interventions show promise for reducing blood pressure in the short term, but the longer-term effects are unclear,\u201d the authors write.\n\nAbstract/Full Text\n\nHaymarket Medical Network\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Haymarket Media, Inc.
