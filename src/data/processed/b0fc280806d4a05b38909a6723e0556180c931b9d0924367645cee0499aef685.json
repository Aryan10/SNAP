  "summary": "During Meta's antitrust trial, CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that TikTok posed a significant competitive threat to Meta's business since 2018, acknowledging that the company's growth slowed dramatically after TikTok's rise in popularity. The testimony came during the FTC's trial that could potentially force Meta to separate Instagram and WhatsApp.",
  "content": "In Meta's antitrust trial on Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that TikTok's success was a significant risk to Meta's business, describing it as a \"top priority\" and a \"highly urgent\" competitive threat when it emerged in 2018.\n\nZuckerberg admitted that TikTok's arrival directly impacted Meta, noting that the company's \"growth slowed down dramatically\" when TikTok gained popularity. The testimony came during the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's trial against the social networking giant, which could potentially require Meta to spin off Instagram or WhatsApp as separate companies.\n\nThe Meta CEO also made notable observations about the evolving nature of social media platforms, stating that apps now serve primarily as discovery engines rather than relying on connections between friends and family for growth. However, Facebook is simultaneously attempting to return to its \"OG roots\" with new features designed to enhance friend connections, including a revamped Friends tab. Zuckerberg identified a \"return to OG Facebook\" as a key goal for 2025.\n\nThe timing of these developments coincides with ByteDance's acquisition of Musical.ly in 2017 and its subsequent merger with TikTok. Around this period, Meta (then Facebook) modified its reporting structure, switching to a \"family of apps\" metric that included Instagram and WhatsApp, reportedly to obscure slowing growth in its main platform.",

If the FTC\u2019s lawyers prevail, the trial could potentially require Meta to spin out Instagram or WhatsApp as separate companies.\n\nNotably, Zuckerberg admitted on Wednesday that TikTok\u2019s arrival had directly impacted Meta, saying his company had observed that its \u201cgrowth slowed down dramatically\u201d when TikTok became popular. He also said the ByteDance-owned app has continued to be a focus of Meta\u2019s competitive efforts for several years.\n\nByteDancepurchasedMusical.ly in 2017, andmergedit with TikTok the following year. Around the same time, Meta (then known as Facebook)stopped reporting Facebook\u2019s user numbersin its quarterly reports, shifting to a new \u201cfamily of apps\u201d metric that encompassed Instagram and WhatsApp. The change was designed to hide the fact that Meta\u2019s flagship app was seeing slowing growth.\n\nZuckerberg made another interesting comment during the trial in response to a question about social media platforms\u2019 \u201cnetwork effects.\u201d He said it\u2019s become less important for social media apps to leverage connections between friends and family to grow.\n\n\u201cThe apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,\u201d Zuckerberg told the court. \u201cPeople can take that content to messaging engines.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, however, Facebook is trying to return to its \u201cOG roots\u201dby turning once again to those network effects. The company recently released new features designed to make it easier to connect with friends, includinga revamped Friends tabthat highlights friend requests and activity. In January, Zuckerberg told investors that a \u201creturn to OG Facebook\u201d was a key goal for 2025.\n\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Editor\n\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.
