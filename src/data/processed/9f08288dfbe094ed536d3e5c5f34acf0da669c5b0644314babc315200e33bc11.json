        "content": "Saturday, April 19 2025, 05:44 PM\n\nBy Nilesh Patel, Managing Director, Kashmik Formulation\n\nNew Delhi [India], April 17:Antibiotic resistance is no longer a looming threat\u2014it is a reality we face today. As someone deeply involved in pharmaceutical manufacturing, I see first-hand how the choices we make at the formulation stage can shape public health outcomes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 700,000 people die each year due to drug-resistant infections. If current trends continue, this number could soar to 10 million annually by 2050. While overuse and misuse of antibiotics remain well-known contributors, we must shine a spotlight on a lesser-known, yet equally critical factor: the formulation of the drugs themselves.\n\nWhy Formulations Matter\n\nThe efficacy of an antibiotic doesn't rest solely on the molecule\u2014it depends heavily on how that molecule is delivered. Suboptimal formulations can lead to inconsistent drug absorption and poor bioavailability, exposing bacteria to sub-therapeutic concentrations. This allows pathogens to survive, adapt, and ultimately become resistant. Smarter formulations ensure the antibiotic reaches the infection site at the right concentration and duration, reducing the risk of resistance taking root.\n\nThe Formulation Strategies We Must Embrace\n\nTo address this challenge, the industry must adopt advanced formulation strategies. Sustained-release systems are a proven solution\u2014they maintain consistent plasma drug levels, reducing the need for frequent dosing and minimizing opportunities for bacterial evasion. Likewise, targeted delivery mechanisms such as liposomes, nanoparticles, and pH-sensitive coatings are revolutionizing the way antibiotics act at the site of infection, enhancing efficacy and limiting collateral damage.\n\nFixed-dose combinations (FDCs), which blend two or more active pharmaceutical ingredient into a single pill, are another powerful tool. They not only reduce the chances of monotherapy misuse but also increase patient compliance by simplifying treatment regimens. Furthermore, patient-centric formats like unit-dose blister packs support adherence, particularly in rural or resource-constrained settings, where proper dosing can be a challenge.\n\nInnovation, Responsibility, and the Road Ahead\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of generic medicines, Indian pharma bears an immense responsibility. We must move beyond cost-efficiency and volume, and toward resistance-conscious, WHO-GMP certified production.\n\nFighting antibiotic resistance requires more than new molecules; it demands smarter, more effective ways to deliver what we already have. Through thoughtful formulation, we can preserve the power of antibiotics and contribute meaningfully to global health security.\n\nDisclaimer:The article is for general information purposes only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.
