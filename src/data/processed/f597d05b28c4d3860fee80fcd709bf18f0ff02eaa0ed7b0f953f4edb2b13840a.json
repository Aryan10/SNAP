        "content": "GST on UPI payments:The government has denied media reports claiming it is considering proposals to levygoods and services tax (GST)onunified payments interface (UPI)transactions exceeding\u20b92,000. The finance ministry clarified on April 18 that claims that it is considering levying GST on UPI transactions over\u20b92,000 are \u201ccompletely false, misleading, and without any basis.\u201d Currently, no such proposal is before the government.\n\nEarlier today, certain media reports claimed thatdigital paymentsmade via UPI exceeding the\u20b92,000 threshold in a single transaction may be brought under the GST framework for compliance. This aimed to enhance tax compliance and bring more digital transactions into the formal economy.\n\n\u201cIf approved, an 18 per cent GST, the standard rate for most digital services, could be levied on high-value transactions. The proposal is still under consideration. The move could significantly shift India\u2019s UPI ecosystem, which has been a cost-free, user-friendly platform,\u201d claimed the reports.\n\nThe finance ministry said that GST is levied on charges, such as the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), relating to payments made using certain instruments. Effective January 2020, theCentral Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)has removed the MDR on Person-to-Merchant (P2M) UPI transactions through the Gazette Notification dated December 30, 2019.\n\nSince no MDR is currently charged on UPI transactions, no GST is consequently applicable. The government remainscommittedto promoting digital payments via UPI. A government-led incentive scheme has been operational from FY 2021-22 to support and sustain UPI's growth.\n\n\u201cThis scheme targets low-value UPI (P2M) transactions, benefiting small merchants by alleviating transaction costs and promoting wider participation and innovation in digital payments,\u201d said the finance ministry.\n\nThe total incentive payouts under this scheme over the years reflect the Government\u2019s sustained commitment to promoting UPI-based digital payments. Allocation under the scheme over the years has been:\n\n\u2022 FY2021-22:\u20b91,389 crore\n\n\u2022 FY2022-23:\u20b92,210 crore\n\n\u2022 FY2023-24:\u20b93,631 crore\n\nThese measures have significantly contributed to India\u2019s robust digital payments ecosystem. According to the ACI Worldwide Report 2024, India accounted for 49 per cent of global real-time transactions in 2023, reaffirming its position as a global leader in digital payments innovation.\n\nUPI transactionvalues have increased exponentially, from\u20b921.3 lakh crore in FY 2019-20 to\u20b9260.56 lakh crore by March 2025. Specifically, P2M transactions have reached\u20b959.3 lakh crore, reflecting growing merchant adoption and consumer confidence in digital payment methods.\n\nCatch all theBusiness News,Economy news,Breaking NewsEvents andLatest NewsUpdates on Live Mint.
