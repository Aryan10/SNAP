  "summary": "Quebec provincial police ended their search for a woman and two young children believed to have crossed the U.S.-Canada border illegally near Trout River, Quebec. The search began after three people were arrested for illegal entry, revealing during interviews that a woman and children were missing. Officials believe the missing group may have left the area by car.",
  "content": "After nearly a full day, a search and rescue operation is over for a woman and two young children who are believed to have crossed the border from the United States into Canada overnight.\n\nQuebec provincial police, who took over the search from the RCMP Thursday, say they believe the missing trio may have left the area by car. They say an investigation is underway.\n\nRCMP said they launched the search around midnight Thursday in the area surrounding Trout River, Que., in the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region, after two men and a woman were arrested Wednesday night for illegally entering the country.\n\nRCMP spokesperson Martina Pillarova said it was only during interviews with those who were arrested that officers learned of the missing woman and children. The ages of the children have not been confirmed, but the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ) told CBC they are believed to be as young as three years old.\n\nThe incident occurs amid increasing illegal border crossings following U.S. policy changes affecting temporary status holders from various countries. The Trump administration's immigration policies and recent cancellations of Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands have created uncertainty, leading more people to seek asylum in Canada.\n\nData shows asylum claims at the Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle border crossing increased from 560 in January to 1,411 as of April 13, though these numbers don't include those whose claims were rejected.",

        "content": "After nearly a full day, a\u00a0search and rescue operation is\u00a0over for a woman and two young children who are believed to have crossed\u00a0the border from the United States into Canada overnight.\n\nQuebec provincial police,\u00a0who took over the search from the RCMP\u00a0Thursday,\u00a0say they believe the missing trio may have\u00a0left the area by car. They say an investigation is underway,\n\nRCMP said they launched the search\u00a0around midnight Thursday in the area surrounding Trout River, Que., in the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region, after two men and a\u00a0woman were arrested Wednesday night for illegally entering the country.\n\nRCMP spokesperson Martina Pillarova said it was only during\u00a0interviews with those who were arrested that officers learned of the\u00a0missing woman and children.\n\nThe ages of the children have not been confirmed, but the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ) told CBC they are believed to be as young as three years old.\n\nPillarova\u00a0said medical emergency services were also on standby\u00a0as there were\u00a0concerns for their safety.\n\n\"They might be injured\u00a0or dehydrated,\" Pillarova said, more than 10 hours after the search began.\n\nThere is an official\u00a0border crossing at Trout River that links the municipality of Elgin, Que., to Constable, N.Y., which is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. most days.\n\nElgin's general manager Guylaine Cloutier said that illegal crossings have increased since U.S. President Donald Trump's second term began, but noted\u00a0it's not a new issue.\n\n\"It's always existed,\" she said, adding that although\u00a0it's worrisome, there's not much the municipality can do to help.\n\n\"We don't have the capacity or resources,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has coincided with a steadily increasing number of asylum claims by would-be refugees in Quebec.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security said last month it was revoking the temporary status of 532,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the country at their own expense with a financial sponsor. It ends April 24.\n\nThe Trump administration has also announced an end to Temporary Protected Status for 600,000 Venezuelans and about 500,000 Haitians \u2014 set to expire in August \u2014 though a federal judge temporarily put that on hold.\n\nFrantz Andr\u00e9, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Action Committee for People Without Status, says the cancellations of these programs have created a wave of fear and uncertainty. He's in contact with people on both sides of the border, including a Haitian man who attempted to cross into Canada Wednesday.\n\n\"People are basically being [told],\u00a0'Go back home because otherwise we'll deport you.'\u00a0So they're worried, they're leaving everything behind, they have like\u00a0family, they don't have time to sell, they actually give away anything they have, including their clothes,\" said Andr\u00e9.\n\nData obtained by Radio-Canada shows that the number of claims\u00a0processed at the\u00a0popular Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle border crossing went from\u00a0560 in January to 1,411 as of April 13.\n\nAndr\u00e9 says those\u00a0statistics, however, don't reflect the number of people whose\u00a0claims were not processed and who were sent back instead.\n\nThe Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement requires people to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach\u00a0\u2014 meaning they can't travel to the U.S., for example, and then claim asylum in Canada.\n\nThere are exceptions, however: would-be refugees can cross the border and claim asylum in Canada if they have a family member in the country or if they are an unaccompanied minor. Another exception exists for anyone who crosses illegally into Canada and hides out for two weeks before making their claim.\n\nAndr\u00e9 argues the U.S. can no longer be considered a safe country for migrants, citing what he describes as its disregard for due process.\n\n\"When you're sent back, there's a good chance they will detain you, put you in a federal prison and deport [you], even though there is a [different] decision from the judge,\" he said.\n\nAmerican policies and their impact on Canada have been front and centre on the federal campaign trail, and Wednesday's French-language leaders' debate was no different.\n\nTheleaders weighed in on immigration, and asylum seekers, in particular.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said he would block individuals coming from the U.S. and seeking asylum in Canada.\n\nLiberal Leader Mark\u00a0Carney said there are limits to what the country can handle.\n\n\"We have to be human, but we have\u00a0to be realistic. Canada can't accept everyone,\" he said, noting\u00a0most asylum seekers would likely be turned back to the U.S. given\u00a0the Safe Third Country Agreement.\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh proposed doing away with the Safe Third Country Agreement.\n\nJournalist\n\nAnnabelle Olivier is a digital journalist at CBC Montreal.
