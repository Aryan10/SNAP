    "content": "Yesterday, I was traveling by bus from Chennai when I met a guy who seemed visibly nervous. He had a small piece of paper with some phone numbers and was asking fellow passengers for their phones to make a call. After a while, he asked to borrow my phone twice. I didn\u2019t think much of it and was happy to help.\n\nLater, when we reached a stop, he turned to me and said, \u201cBro, I\u2019m in a big problem.\u201d He then asked if I\u2019d join him for a cup of tea. That\u2019s when he opened up and shared his story with me.\n\nHe recently got married\u2014just three months ago\u2014to his girlfriend. Both are 27 years old and from different castes. His family opposed the marriage, and her family, especially her father (who is quite wealthy), wanted her to marry a rich doctor. She is a physiotherapist, and he works in IT.\n\nThey were living in Walajah, away from Chennai, until recently. Her father managed to use his influence\u2014possibly by bribing police\u2014and sent two policemen to their place, saying they just needed to visit the Chennai police station to sign some documents. Since they are adults and married with consent, they didn\u2019t expect anything serious.\n\nBut once they reached the police station, they were separated. The guy was humiliated, his phone, wallet, and photos were taken, and he was threatened to return to his hometown. None of his family or friends are supporting him. His wife was taken away by her family, despite crying and protesting. (He also mentioned she is pregnant, but her family doesn\u2019t know yet.)\n\nNow, he\u2019s completely hopeless. He has little to no money. The police have asked him to come again to Chennai with all the documents related to their marriage and also to resolve some minor issue involving his ex-girlfriend (he claims it\u2019s nothing serious, just something the police dug up).\n\nHe fears that if his wife stays at her parents\u2019 house for two months, they might forcefully marry her off to someone else or brainwash her.\n\nHe wants to hire a good lawyer to help them reunite, but he has no idea how to go about it.\n\nCan someone please help or guide me on what can be done legally so that:\n\n1. They can meet or talk again.\n2. She is not forcibly married off.\n3. They are protected from harassment by police or her family.\n4. He can take legal action to live with his wife peacefully.\nAny help or legal advice would be deeply appreciated."
