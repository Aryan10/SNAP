    "content": "I was visiting Thanjavur and Kumbakonam, and around 9 PM, I was walking from the Thanjavur Periya Kovil to the Old Bus Stand. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise from pehind. It was from scooters. An accident had just happened. A guy on a scooter was riding on the wrong side, and while trying to avoid him, another boy, probably in his teenage years, ended up getting into an accident. From what I saw, I don't think there was a collision, but the boy lost control and fell. The guy who caused it fled the scene immediately\n \nPeople nearby rushed in to help, and the boy went unconscious. I know it's not always the right move to nterfere physically in such situations, especially without proper training, because sometimes it can cause more harm than good. Everyone around was trying to help in their own way. Some were attempting to unlock his phone to reach his parents or friends. I wasn't sure what else to do, but I felt I had to act. So, i searched google for ambulance number and for the first time in my life, I called 108.\n \nTo be honest, I used to think services like 108 were just for show. But the person on the line took the details seriously, and within 10 minutes, an ambulance was arranged. The driver even called me to coordinate. When i talking to ambulancedriver, a group of his friends, a bunch of teenagers arrived. Even though the boy was still not fully conscious, they lifted him and took him away on a scooter. I don't know where they were headed. I told this to driver and he told me call 108 inform them to cancel ambulance, I called 108 again and cancelled the ambulance.\n \nI'm sharing this here to spread some awareness, especially for people like me who didn't know how real and responsive 108 can be. In this case, I wasn't able to do much, but I've realized that everyone can do something. Our government system isn't as bad as we often think. Sometimes, it just takes someone to act.\n\nI hope that boy is okay."
