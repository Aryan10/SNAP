Where are the manufacturing zones, the industrial clusters, the real support for Indian MSMEs? For years, we've been served slogans, photo-ops, and startup summits-while China kept shipping in everything from machinery to toys to diodes. And we kept importing.\nIf we can't even produce basic components or consumer goods at scale, what are we even doing?\nThis isn't just a trade number. This is economic dependence-and worse, national vulnerability.\nWe need manufacturing reform, not just schemes.\nWe need supply chains, not supply speeches.\nWe need execution, not excuses.\nIndia deserves better.\n#TradeDeficit #China #MakelnIndia\n#AtmanirbharBharat #EconomicRealityCheck"
