  "summary": "Scientists from NJIT discovered a new extinct species of Caribbean \"dirt ant\" preserved in 16-million-year-old Dominican amber. Named Basiceros enana, this tiny predator measures just 5mm and reveals surprising evolutionary insights, including that modern relatives are twice its size, contrary to previous theories about size evolution in the species.",

        "content": "A fossilized ant encased in 16-million-year-old amber has revealed a now-extinct predator that once thrived in the Caribbean\u2014flipping scientists\u2019 expectations about its size, evolution, and survival.\n\nA remarkable discovery has given scientists a clearer view into the distant past of Earth\u2019s biodiversity. Researchers from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) have uncovered the first fossil of a Caribbean \u201cdirt ant\u201d, preserved in16-million-year-old Dominican amber. The ancient ant, now identified as a new extinct species namedBasiceros enana, is smaller than any living relative of its genus and offers critical insight into the evolution, migration, and extinction of insect lineages in the region. The findings were published in thejournalProceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\nMeasuring just over5 millimeters,Basiceros enanamay be tiny, but it carries huge evolutionary significance. Dirt ants\u2014so named for theirremarkable camouflage\u2014usespecialized hairson their bodies to bind particles of soil and debris, a trait known ascrypsis. These same adaptations are seen in this fossil, indicating that such survival strategies were already in placemillions of years ago.\n\nThanks to advancedMicro-CT scanningand 3D modeling, the team could examine the fossil in fine detail, revealingmandibles with 12 triangular teeth, a uniquetrapezoidal head, and two distinct layers of dirt-binding hairs. These features suggest it was apredatory species\u2014possibly one of many that once roamed the ancient Caribbean forests.\n\nOne of the study\u2019s most surprising findings is thereversal of size expectations. While previous theories suggested dirt ants were ancestrally large and shrank over time,Basiceros enanareveals the opposite: this ancient species wassignificantly smaller, with modern descendants nearlytwice its size.\n\n\u201cThis flips that on its head,\u201d saidGianpiero Fiorentino, lead author of the study. \u201cIt really illustrates how important fossils can be to understanding the evolution of a lineage.\u201d The rapid size increase over 20 million years challenges assumptions about the group\u2019s evolutionary pressures and raises new questions about what drove their growth and geographical spread.\n\nThe discovery also provides compelling evidence that theCaribbean once hosted species now found only in Central and South America. \u201cA fossil like this underscores how the distribution of living species can belie the complex evolutionary history of life on our planet,\u201d saidPhil Barden, senior author and NJIT professor.\n\nThe presence ofBasicerosin Dominican amber suggests ancient land bridges may have allowed them to migrate into the islands. But while modern dirt ants have survived elsewhere, this Caribbean lineage did not. The study points to possible reasons, such asniche collapse, environmental change, orcompetition, for their local extinction during theMiocene epoch.\n\n\u201cOver a third of ant genera have gone extinct on the island of modern-day Dominican Republic since the formation of Dominican amber,\u201d Fiorentino noted. Understanding such patterns could offer lessons forpreserving modern biodiversityin the face of climate change and human activity.\n\nComment\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\u00a9 2024 | Indian Defence Review\u00a0 | All rights reserved"
