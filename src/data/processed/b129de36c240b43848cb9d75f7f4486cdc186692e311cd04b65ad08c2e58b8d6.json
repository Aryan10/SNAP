  "summary": "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is investigating Tata Consultancy Services following complaints of discriminatory layoffs. Former employees allege the company unfairly targeted Americans over 40 while retaining Indian H-1B visa workers. TCS denies all allegations of discrimination, though the probe has gained attention from lawmakers and coincides with increased scrutiny of work visa programs.",
  "content": "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is investigating Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) following over two dozen complaints filed since late 2023. Complainants, predominantly over 40 and from non-South Asian backgrounds, allege discriminatory targeting in layoffs while Indian employees on H-1B visas were retained.\n\nTCS has firmly denied these allegations, stating that claims of unlawful discrimination are \"meritless and misleading.\" The company emphasizes its commitment to equal opportunity in U.S. operations.\n\nThe investigation, which began during Biden's presidency and continues under Trump's administration, follows a similar pattern to a 2020 EEOC case against Cognizant that resulted in a verdict confirming discrimination against American workers.\n\nControversy emerged when TCS's global HR head, Milind Lakkad, reportedly discussed plans to reduce U.S. workforce share from 70% to 50% in favor of Indian hires. This prompted U.S. Representative Seth Moulton to request formal EEOC investigation.\n\nThe case has broader implications for work visa programs, particularly H-1B and L-1A, which face increasing scrutiny. Similar allegations have emerged in the UK, where former employees have filed tribunal claims alleging age and nationality discrimination.\n\nTCS, employing over 600,000 people globally and serving major U.S. clients, maintains its commitment to fair employment practices while operating under intensified regulatory oversight.",

        "content": "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is investigating Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) following over two dozen complaints filed since late 2023, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMany complainants, reportedly over the age of 40 and from non-South Asian backgrounds, allege they were unfairly targeted in layoffs, while Indian employees \u2014 particularly those on H-1B visas \u2014 were retained.\n\nTCS has denied all allegations. \u201cClaims that TCS engages in unlawful discrimination are meritless and misleading,\u201d a company spokesperson said, emphasizing the firm\u2019s commitment to equal opportunity and integrity in its U.S. operations.\n\nThe EEOC declined to comment on the ongoing investigation due to confidentiality rules. However, Bloomberg reports that the probe began during President Biden\u2019s tenure and has continued into President Trump\u2019s current administration.\n\nThe complaints echo a 2020 EEOC case against Cognizant, another outsourcing firm, where the agency found systemic bias against non-Indian workers. That case culminated in a 2023 jury verdict confirming intentional discrimination against over 2,000 American employees. Cognizant denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal.\n\nThe TCS case appears to follow a similar trajectory, with former employees referencing internal comments by Milind Lakkad, the company\u2019s global HR head, who told Indian media that TCS aimed to reduce its U.S. workforce share from 70% to 50% in favor of Indian hires.\n\nIn April 2024, U.S. Representative Seth Moulton (D-MA) urged the EEOC to formally investigate, citing complaints from constituents and possible misuse of U.S. visa programs. \u201cTCS\u2019s actions may reflect a pattern-or-practice of discrimination against American workers,\u201d Moulton wrote.\n\nWork visa programs such as H-1B and L-1A are under growing scrutiny. A 2023 Bloomberg investigation found that outsourcing firms have used their vast overseas workforces to flood the annual H-1B visa lottery, limiting access for smaller companies and U.S. job seekers. TCS has also been accused of misusing the L-1A visa to bypass H-1B caps\u2014allegations the company denies.\n\nAndrea R. Lucas, appointed EEOC acting chair by President Trump in January, has pledged stricter enforcement against what she calls \u201cunlawful bias against American workers.\u201d In February, she emphasized that such practices undermine U.S. labor protections and immigration policy.\n\nThe controversy isn\u2019t limited to the U.S. In the UK, three former TCS employees have filed employment tribunal claims alleging age and nationality discrimination during a 2023 redundancy process. TCS has denied those allegations as well.\n\nTCS, India\u2019s largest IT services provider and part of the Tata Group, employs over 600,000 people worldwide and serves major U.S. clients across industries, including airlines, automakers, and financial institutions.\n\nEmail us at[email\u00a0protected]"
