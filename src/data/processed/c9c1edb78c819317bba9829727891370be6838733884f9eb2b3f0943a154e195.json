        "content": "Reporter\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on March 04, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n\nReporter\n\nThe United States was added Sunday to the CIVICUS Monitor Watchlist, a research tool that publicizes the status of freedoms and threats to civil liberties worldwide.\n\nThe move comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cassault on democratic norms and global cooperation,\u201d said CIVICUS\u2014a global alliance and network of civil society groups, including Amnesty International, that advocates for greater citizen action in areas where civil liberties are limited\u2014in a press release. The organization also cited the Administration\u2019s cut ofmore than 90% of its foreign aid contractsand its crackdown ondiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)\u2014which Trump called \u201cillegal and immoral discrimination programs\u201d\u2014through executive action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration seems hellbent on dismantling the system of checks and balances which are the pillars of a democratic society,\u201d said Mandeep Tiwana, Interim Co-Secretary General of CIVICUS, in a press release. \u201cRestrictive Executive Orders, unjustifiable institutional cutbacks, and intimidation tactics through threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the Administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal.\u201d\n\nMore From TIME\n\nOther countries on the watchlist include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Italy, Pakistan, and Serbia.\n\nCIVICUSoutlines the state of civil rights through five categories\u2014open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed, and closed. \u201cOpen\u201d is the highest ranking, meaning all people are able to practice liberties such as free speech, and the lowest is \u201cclosed.\u201d Per CIVICUS, instances that result in a \u201cdecline in open civic space\u201d include \u201crepressive legislation that curtails free speech and dialogue, obstacles to civil society activities and operations and crackdowns on civil disobedience and peaceful demonstrations.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has been classified as \u201cnarrowed.\u201d The \u201cnarrowed\u201d label is CIVICUS\u2019 assessment that while most people are able to exercise their rights of expression, free speech, and assembly, there are some attempts to violate these rights by the government. For example, CIVICUS citedcrackdowns on pro-Palestinian protestorsduring the Biden Administration, after advocates took to the streets and stagedcollege encampmentsto voice their discontent with the military assistance and funding the U.S. was sending to Israel. Students participated in demonstrations to demand their schoolsdivest from any companiesthat profit from or have a relationship with Israel.\n\n\u201cWe urge the United States to uphold the rule of law and respect constitutional and international human rights norms,\u201d said Tiwana. \u201cAmericans across the political spectrum are appalled by the undemocratic actions of the current Administration.\u201d\n\nThe White House has rejected CIVICUS\u2019 assessment. \u201cThis is nonsense: President Trump is leading the most transparent administration in history,\u201d said Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly in an email statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe \"narrowed\" category also reflects CIVICUS\u2019 assessment that while there is an existing free press, there may be restrictions due to regulation or political pressure on media owners.\n\nThis comes at a time when the editorial decisions made by major media organizations and governing bodies have prompted much discussion.\n\nIn February, the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation into NPR and PBS due to concerns that they were \u201cviolating federal law by airing commercials,\u201d which bothnewsroom CEOs deny. The FCC chair alsospoke outagainst public funding for the two news sites.\n\nJeff Bezos, Amazon CEO and owner of the WashingtonPost, directed the organization to change the scope of its opinion pages in February, informing the team that they will be writing \u201cin support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,\u201d Bezos saidin his noteto thePostteam.\n\nThat same month, the White House announced its press team will pick the reporters who participate in the press pool\u2014a move theWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saidis about \u201crestoring power back to the American people, who President Trump was elected to serve.\u201d However, many journalism advocates criticized the act. \u201cThis move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States. It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president. In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps,\u201d the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said in astatement on Feb. 25.\n\nThe White House is also currently ensnared in a lawsuit brought forward by the Associated Press. The news organization hassued three Trump Administration officials\u2014including Leavitt\u2014after it was barred from access to the White House press briefings because it refused to change its editorial style and refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the \u201cGulf of America,\u201d after Trump renamed it in anExecutive Orderhe signed in January.\n\n\u00a92025TIME USA, LLC.
