  "summary": "Kazakhstan is preparing to send a delegation to Washington for trade talks amid US tariff concerns. Deputy Trade Minister Zhanel Kushukova announced the country's non-confrontational approach, avoiding retaliatory measures. Kazakhstan's trade with the US reached $3.4 billion in 2024, with discussions expected to cover tariffs and rare earth minerals trade.",
  "content": "Kazakhstan is adopting a non-confrontational stance as it finesses trade relations with the United States, seeking engagement rather than retaliation over the imposition of US tariffs.\n\nDeputy Trade Minister Zhanel Kushukova told journalists on April 17 that the government intended to send a delegation to Washington to hold talks on a variety of trade issues, including tariffs. The Trump administration initially hit Kazakh goods with a 27-percent tariff rate, but subsequently scaled the rate back provisionally to 10 percent, with a 90-day pause on tariff imposition.\n\nKazakh officials are embracing a do-no-harm approach in response to US policymaking.

        "content": "Kazakhstan is adopting a non-confrontational stance as it finesses trade relations with the United States, seeking engagement rather than retaliation overthe\u00a0impositionof US tariffs.\n\nDeputy Trade Minister Zhanel Kushukova told journalists on April 17 that the government intended to send a delegation to Washington to hold talks on a variety of trade issues, including tariffs. The Trump administration initially hit Kazakh goods with a27-percent\u00a0tariff\u00a0rate, but subsequently scaled the rate back provisionally to 10 percent. In addition, the Trump administration has placed a 90-day pause on the imposition of tariffs.\n\n\u201cAll countries are now interested in holding consultations with the USA about duties, and we are no exception,\u201d the InBusiness.kz news agencyquotedKushkova as saying. \u201cWe are currently working on this issue within the government and are preparing for consultations.\u201d She provided no timeframe for when the Kazakh delegation would depart for the United States.\n\nAs the tariff and other trade issues play out, Kazakh officials are embracing a do-no-harm approach in response to the constant zigs and zags of US policymaking. Kushkova emphasized that Kazakhstan had no intention of imposing reciprocal tariffs on US goods, citing the country\u2019s membership in the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) trade bloc as a factor in Astana\u2019s policy of restraint.\n\n\u201cA single customs tariff applies to five [EAEU member] states. That is, if any duties are to be changed on imported goods, then it can only be by a decision of the five,\u201d Kushkovasaid. \u201cBut today, such an issue is not even considered.\u201d Russia, the EAEU\u2019s dominant member, has so far beenexemptedfrom US tariffs, even though it is subjected to extensivesanctionsimposed by the US and European Union.\n\nKazakhstan in 2024 had the highest overall trade turnover with the United States of all Central Asian states, totaling $3.4 billion, of which more than two-thirds comprised US-bound Kazakh exports, mainly carbon resources and other commodities. Kazakh officials have noted that energy and other raw-material exports would be exempt from tariffs under the present US framework.\n\nThe planned Kazakh delegation would have plenty to discuss with US officials in Washington beyond tariffs. Since taking power, the Trump administration has repeatedlyexpressed\u00a0interestto striking trade deals concerning Kazakhstan\u2019sabundant\u00a0reservesof rare earths. US interest in securing an increase in Kazakh mineral supplies is only intensifying in the wake of aChinese\u00a0banon rare earth exports.\n\nThe top US diplomat in Kazakhstan, Deborah Robinson, earlier in AprilreaffirmedUS support \u201cfor private and public sector cooperation in the critical minerals sector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, data published by Kazakhstan\u2019s State Statistics Agency provides fresh evidence that Russia is having an increasingly difficult time using the Central Asian nation as a back door for sanctions-busting trade.\n\nKazakh authorities insist that they are enforcing US and EU sanctions. Nevertheless, the countryhas\u00a0long\u00a0been\u00a0suspectedas anenablerofillicit\u00a0transitin dual-use technology and goods that can help maintain Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. Avarietyof Kazakh-basedentitieshave beenaddedto the US sanctions list since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022.\n\nOf late, however, Russian business representatives in Kazakhstan have complained about tightening financial regulations that hinder their ability to operate, according to reportsdistributedby state-controlled Russian media.\n\nThe data published by QazStat supports the notion that Kazakhstan\u2019s is becoming a less hospitable environment for sanctions-busting activity. The number of Russian companies operating in Kazakhstan has been gradually declining for a year now, following a long period of explosive growth, the official statistics show.\n\nIn January 2022, the month before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, roughly 7,900 Russian entities operated in Kazakhstan. By the end of that year, the number nearly doubled to 15,700.\n\nThe number of actively operating Russian entities in Kazakhstan peaked during the first quarter of 2024, totaling19,735. Since then, the numbers have declined by a few hundred each quarter, and stood at18,366as of April 1 of this year, a 7 percent drop over the four-quarter period.\n\nSign upfor Eurasianet's free weekly newsletter.Support Eurasianet:Help keep our journalism open to all, and influenced by none."
