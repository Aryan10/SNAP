The decision to reverse the Biden Administration\u2019s partial arms embargo, which wrongly withheld a number of weapons and ammunition from Israel, is yet another sign that Israel has no greater ally in the White House than President Trump.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump Administration has approved nearly $12 billion in major FMS sales to Israel. This important decision coincides with President Trump\u2019s repeal of a Biden-era memorandum which had imposed baseless and politicized conditions on military assistance to Israel at a time when our close ally was fighting a war of survival on multiple fronts against Iran and terror proxies.\n\nThe Trump Administration will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America\u2019s long-standing commitment to Israel\u2019s security, including means to counter security threats.\n\nTags\n\nWe use cookies to make our website work better and improve your experience.
