        "content": "Shin Si Ah is impressing viewers with her performance in \u201cResident Playbook\u201d!\n\nA spin-off of the hit series \u201cHospital Playlist,\u201d tvN\u2019s \u201cResident Playbook\u201d is a new drama depicting the realistic and relatable hospital lives, growth, and heartwarming friendships of residents at the Jongro branch of Yulje Medical Center.\n\nShin Si Ah plays Pyo Nam Kyung, a first-year obstetrics and gynecology resident. At first glance, Pyo Nam Kyung appears smart and assertive, but she also goes through emotional ups and downs and has a clumsy side that makes her more relatable. Shin Si Ah portrays these complex aspects of Pyo Nam Kyung\u2019s personality naturally and without exaggeration, delivering a performance that impresses viewers.\n\nOne of Pyo Nam Kyung\u2019s most memorable scenes is her first day at Yulje Medical Center, where she shows great chemistry with Oh Yi Young (Go Youn Jung). But it was the episode where Um Jae Il (Kang You Seok) mistakes patient Yeom Mi So (Hyun Jin) for a pregnant woman that truly highlighted Shin Si Ah\u2019s acting skills.\n\nWhen the attending physician for patient Yeom Mi So changes from Um Jae Il to Pyo Nam Kyung, she is thrown into a difficult routine, dealing with numerous tasks and the demanding needs of the patient. Shin Si Ah convincingly portrays Pyo Nam Kyung\u2019s exhaustion as her workload piles up, realistically capturing the fatigue of a first-year resident.\n\nIn particular, in a scene where Pyo Nam Kyung mistakenly believes that Yeom Mi So has passed away and is filled with anxiety, only to shed tears of relief after confirming she\u2019s alive, Shin Si Ah brilliantly conveys the character\u2019s emotional shift, deeply moving viewers. Viewers are eagerly anticipating how her character will grow and evolve emotionally in the future.\n\nThe next episode of \u201cResident Playbook\u201d will air on April 19 at 9:20 p.m. KST!\n\nSource (1)"
