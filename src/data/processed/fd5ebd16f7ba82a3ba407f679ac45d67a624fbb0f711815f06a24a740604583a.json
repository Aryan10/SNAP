The announcement came during Prime Minister Meloni's White House visit, where both nations agreed on creating a non-discriminatory environment for digital services taxation to encourage tech investments.",

Ms Meloni said she was \"sure\" they could reach a deal.\n\nWatch: Trump and Meloni talk up EU tariff deal hopes\n\nCasting herself as the only European who can de-escalate Mr Trump's trade war, Ms Meloni highlighted their conservative common ground and said she wanted to \"make the West great again\".\n\nMs Meloni's decision to personally intercede with Mr Trump has caused some disquiet among EU allies, who are concerned that her visit could undermine bloc unity.\n\nWhile Mr Trump expressed confidence about an eventual deal with the 27-nation bloc he accuses of trying to \"screw\" the United States, he said yesterday that he was in \"no rush\".\n\nT\u00e1naiste Simon Harris met Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other US officials in Washington last week.\n\nMs Meloni said Mr Trump had accepted an invitation to visit Rome in the \"near future\" and that he might also meet European leaders there.\n\n\"Even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions,\" she said.\n\nMs Meloni highlighted their shared views on immigration and \"woke\" ideology and added: \"The goal for me is to make the west great again, and I think we can do it together.\"\n\n'Get smart'\n\nMr Trump also returned to his administration's familiar criticisms of Europe, saying it needed to \"get smart\" on immigration and boost defence spending on NATO.\n\nThe US leader said separately that superpower rival China had \"reached out\" about a possible deal to end the bitter trade war between the world's biggest economies.\n\nMr Trump has slapped eye-watering 145% tariffs on Chinese goods after it retaliated to his worldwide \"Liberation Day \" tariffs announcement on 2 April.\n\n\"I think we're going to make a very good deal with China,\" he added.\n\nRead more:China says it will ignore US 'tariff numbers game'\n\nUncertainty\n\nMs Meloni had earlier acknowledged the uncertainty weighing on her trip as Europe reels from repeated blows from a country that has been the continent's defender for decades.\n\n\"I am aware of what I represent and I am aware of what I am defending,\" Ms Meloni said.\n\nItalian newspapers reported that one of the goals of Ms Meloni's visit was to pave the way for a meeting between Mr Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nMs Meloni's decision to personally intercede with Mr Trump has caused some disquiet among EU allies, who are concerned that her visit could undermine bloc unity.\n\n\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" France's Industry Minister Marc Ferracci warned last week.\n\nA European Commission spokeswoman said that while the EU alone could negotiate trade agreements, Ms Meloni's \"outreach is very welcome\" and was coordinated with Brussels.\n\nAccreditation:AFP\n\n\u00a9 RT\u00c9 2025.
