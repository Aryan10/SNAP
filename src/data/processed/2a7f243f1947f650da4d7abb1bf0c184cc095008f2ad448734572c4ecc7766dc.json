  "summary": "An eight-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been formed to investigate a Varanasi gang-rape case after families of the accused challenged the complainant's allegations. The case involves a 19-year-old woman who alleged she was gang-raped over five days, leading to 14 arrests. The accused families have raised multiple inconsistencies in the complaint, including the delayed missing person report and the victim's social media activity during the alleged incident period.",
  "content": "The Varanasi Police Commissioner Mohit Agarwal has constituted an eight-member Special Investigation Team to investigate a gang-rape case following challenges to the complainant's claims by the accused families.\n\nThe SIT, led by Deputy Commissioner of Police Pramod Kumar, will ensure a transparent investigation and prevent wrongful implications. The team includes ADCPs Shruti Srivastava and Neetu, ACP Vidhush Saxena, and four inspector-rank officials.\n\nThe case emerged when a 19-year-old woman's father filed a missing person's complaint on April 4 for his daughter's disappearance since March 29. After being found at a friend's house, the woman filed a complaint alleging she was \"wrongfully confined and gang-raped\" for five days at multiple locations in Varanasi.\n\nThe families of the accused have raised several contradictions, including the delayed missing person report, lack of injury marks, CCTV footage showing the complainant \"walking cheerfully\" with accused persons, and active social media presence during the alleged incident. They claim the FIR is \"part of a planned scheme to blackmail and extort money.\"\n\nPolice Commissioner Agarwal confirmed that DNA profiling of the 14 arrested accused is underway. The police reported that no external injuries were found during the complainant's medical examination.",

        "content": "An eight-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was constituted on Thursday to probe the Varanasi gang-rape case after the families of the arrested accused submitted an application to the police, picking holes in the allegations levelled by the 19-year-old complainant, officials said.\n\nThe SIT, formed by Varanasi Police Commissioner Mohit Agarwal, has been tasked with ensuring that the \u201cinvestigation is conducted transparently and no innocent person is wrongly implicated in the case\u201d.\n\nThe police have arrested 14 persons in the case so far.\n\nThe SIT will be headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Pramod Kumar and has ADCPs Shruti Srivastava and Neetu, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Vidhush Saxena and four inspector-rank officials as its members.\n\nIn a press statement, the Varanasi police said the eight-member team \u201cwill also examine any new facts that emerge during the probe\u201d and that \u201cany accused not named in the FIR but identified during the course of the investigation will be arrested only after a recommendation of the SIT\u201d.\n\nThe 19-year-old\u2019s father had on April 4 filed a missing person\u2019s complaint, stating that his daughter was missing since March 29. The police traced the woman to her friend\u2019s house later that evening. The next day, the teenaged woman, accompanied by her parents, visited the local police station and filed a complaint, alleging she was \u201cwrongfully confined and gang-raped\u201d for five days. She claimed that she was drugged by some of the accused and taken to multiple locations in Varanasi, including a hotel and a caf\u00e9, where she was sexually assaulted.\n\nAn FIR was registered on charges of gang rape and criminal confinement against 12 persons by name and 11 unidentified individuals.\n\nIn their application to the police, the families of the accused questioned why no missing person\u2019s report was filed for five days since she went missing on March 29. They also questioned why the complainant did not report the alleged rape to the police when she was recovered from her friend\u2019s house on April 4.\n\nThey said even as the complainant claimed to have been raped between March 29 and April 4, she stayed twice at her friend\u2019s house and did not mention the sexual assault incident to her friend. They also questioned why no visible injury marks found on her body if she was allegedly raped by 23 people. She did not return home even as her friend\u2019s house is around 500 metres from her residence, they said.\n\nIn their letter, they claimed that CCTV footage from March 31 showed the complainant walking cheerfully with three of the accused. Several posts and photos were uploaded on the victim\u2019s Instagram account on April 2, in which she appeared hale and hearty, they further claimed.\n\nThe letter also stated that the victim messaged one of the accused on Instagram on March 31, informing him that she was coming to a caf\u00e9. The family questioned why the victim did not raise an alarm at the hotels and caf\u00e9s where she claimed to have been assaulted. They also asked why she went with the same accused again on April 3, despite claiming to have been sexually assaulted by him on March 31.\n\nThe police said some people claimed that the complainant was initially unwilling to return to her parents\u2019 home after she was recovered.\n\nThe families also alleged that the complainant\u2019s family demanded money from some of the accused, threatening to implicate them in case they didn\u2019t pay up. The FIR, they alleged, was part of a planned scheme to blackmail and extort money.\n\nThey claimed that the girl\u2019s parents knew of her whereabouts between March 29 and April 4, and that most of the accused were previously connected to the woman through Instagram.\n\nWhen contacted, Police Commissioner Mohit Agarwal said the SIT will also examine the evidence against the 14 accused arrested in the case. \u201cThe DNA profiling of the accused is also being done,\u201d he added.\n\nThe SIT will also probe the allegation that the victim did not name some of the persons named in the FIR in her statement before the magistrate, it is learnt.\n\nDuring her medical examination no external injuries were found on the complainant, a police officer said."
