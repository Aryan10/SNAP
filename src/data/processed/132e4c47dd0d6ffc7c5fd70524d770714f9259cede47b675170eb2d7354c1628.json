        "content": "There is a temple next to Badrinath, Urvashi Rautela claims, that has been built in her honour. She says devotees garland her photos. She says students from Delhi University worship her. And she's not joking.\n\nOnce upon a time, statements like these might have been dismissed as harmless celebrity eccentricities (or afirmly tongue-in-cheek interview, like this one by Kishore Kumar). But, Urvashi Rautela is no Kishore Kumar, and neither is what she says harmless anymore. It's no longer even about celebrity. It's about the complete, public unravelling of (a lack of) self-awareness - the making of a myth so laughably exaggerated that it deserves a separate genre altogether.\n\nAnd at this point, we must ask: where is the line between self-belief and sheer delusion?\n\nSpeaking to Siddharth Kannan recently, Urvashi Rautela said with a straight face, \"There is a temple in my name in Uttarakhand. If one visits Badrinath, there is a 'Urvashi temple' right next to it.\"\n\nFactually, Urvashi is not wrong.There is indeed an Urvashi Temple in Badrinath, Uttarakhand, about 1.5 kilometres from the main Badrinath temple. Where Rautela is wrong, however, is who the temple is dedicated to. No, it's not her.\n\nThe Urvashi Temple in Badrinath is believed to be the birthplace of Urvashi, the apsara in Hindu mythology, whom Narayana created out of his left thigh.\n\nThis Urvashi and Urvashi Rautela only share a name.\n\nShe added that she now hopes to see one built in her honour in South India too.\n\nWhen asked if devotees actually pray 'to her' at the Badrinath temple, she quipped, \"Ab mandir hai toh woh hi toh karenge,\" before adding that even Delhi University students garland her photos and refer to her affectionately as \"Damdami Mai\".\n\nThis, again, isn't totally off the mark.\n\nEvery year on Valentine's Day, students of Hindu College in Delhi University indulge in a uniquely bizarre tradition - the \"Damdami Mai\" puja, also known as the Worship of the Virgin Tree. A designated tree on campus becomes the shrine, adorned with posters of a chosen Bollywood actress, complete with garlands and incense.\n\nAnd yes, they take it a step further - condoms (sometimes water-filled) dangle from its branches like twisted festive ornaments, all in a half-joking, half-hopeful attempt to summon romantic luck. It's less about devotion and more about dopamine, and Urvashi being invoked as \"Damdami Mai\" says more about college humour than actual reverence.\n\nUrvashi's temple claim is not her first brush with self-deification. In 2022, she posted a picture of a fan performing an actual puja in front of her photo displayed on a laptop - incense sticks, tika, a full aarti thali. The word she chose to describe it? \"Urvashism.\" Fans ran with it, hashtags were born, and the absurdity grew its own fanbase.\n\nBut make no mistake - this is not adoration she shirks from. It's adoration she encourages, re-posts and performs for. She is not just playing the goddess. She's writing her own scripture too.\n\nUrvashi's obsession with being the \"first\" is a category in itself. She has described herself as the first Indian woman to wear a gold Manipuri potloi on the ramp. The first Indian actress to be invited to the Paris Olympics 2024. The first Bollywood actress to speak fluent French. The youngest \"most beautiful woman in the universe\".\n\nThe list reads less like a resume and more like a running gag on a Reddit thread. Because that's where most of these claims end up - mocked, questioned and taken apart by the Internet - which has done a better job of fact-checking her than her PR team ever has.\n\nHer Instagram bio alone is a hall of fame of unverifiable titles, self-awarded superlatives and proclamations that sound more like the pitch of a satire than the persona of a serious artist.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that these aren't just exaggerated claims. Some are flat-out misleading. She declared she was leading a Parveen Babi biopic - except, there is no such project, no production team, no official confirmation. It was all \"bogus news\", as industry sources later said.\n\nThen came theKantara 2fiasco - she posted a selfie with actor Rishab Shetty and hinted at being cast in the prequel. The makers had to release a clarification and mentioned that she was never part of the film and was simply at the same event.\n\nIt's the same pattern: claim, confuse, wait for backlash, move on. Repeat.\n\nAnd then, from the recent past, there's theSaif Ali Khan incident- a moment that should have called for sensitivity. When asked about the shocking stabbing of the actor at his Mumbai home, Urvashi launched into a bizarre monologue about her diamond-studded Rolex and the miniature watch gifted by her parents.\n\nHer concern for Saif was buried under blinding carats. The response was not just tone-deaf - it was offensive. Later, she apologised, but it was too late (so, she deleted the post). What she revealed in that moment was a complete inability to step outside of herself - even when it is someone else's trauma.\n\nWhenDaaku Maharaaj, her latest offering, outperformedGame Changerat the box office, she couldn't help but rub it in. \"Kiara's film is a disaster,\" she quoted X (formerly Twitter) users saying, smugly adding, \"Isme meri toh koi galti nahi hai.\"\n\nShe calls herself the \"best promoter\" in the business, second only to Shah Rukh Khan. It would be funny if it weren't said with such unwavering conviction.\n\nIn a world where humility is already in short supply, Urvashi Rautela has chosen to walk the path of relentless, performative ego. And every now and then, that ego trips.\n\nOnline platforms, especially Reddit and X (formerly Twitter), have become unofficial archives of Urvashi's more extravagant claims.\n\nThreads are dedicated to fact-checking her statements, with users half-amused and half-bewildered by her relentless reinventions. The phrase \"delulu is the solulu\" might have been coined for K-pop stans, but it fits the actress herself - like a Rolex finger-watch.\n\nEven when she was hospitalised for a minor finger injury, fans (unverified) sent her one lakh roses. Predictably, she posted the photos. Predictably, she turned her recovery into a spectacle. But the real question is: what is Urvashi applauded for?\n\nThe answer seems to be: for existing loudly enough. For mastering the algorithm of attention. For building a brand that's more myth than substance.\n\nThere is no denying that Urvashi Rautela works hard. She hustles. She promotes. She shows up. But that's not the problem. The problem is that the performance has completely swallowed the person. The narrative has overtaken the truth. And the persona that she has created for herself is now too bloated to be taken seriously.\n\nEvery star plays a part. Every celebrity builds a version of themselves. But with Urvashi, the performance has become a parody. And unlike the roles she plays on screen, this one doesn't come with a script editor.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with ambition. But when ambition turns into self-worship, and the worship turns into delusion, someone needs to ask: where is the line?\n\nShe won't draw it. Maybe Reddit will.\n\nAxiom-4 is a private commercial space flight where India is paying between $60-70 million for the mission.\n\nFormer spy chief AS Dulat's book, 'The Chief Minister and the Spy', has created ripples in Kashmiri politics.\n\nMore than five decades since the Bangladesh Liberation War, Dhaka appears to be pursuing closer ties with Pakistan, with riders.\n\nIn essence, Sebi has said funds raised by Gensol to purchase EVs for BluSmart had, via \"layered transactions\", been partially used for personal enrichment.\n\nThe National Herald, founded by Jawaharlal Nehru and other freedom fighters in 1938, was a newspaper owned and published by Associated Journals Limited, or AJL.\n\nIf any sport can be used to define the impact of social media, it is Formula 1. In 2017, it was owned by an 87-year-old man out of touch with the 'new gen'. In 2025, F1 is a cool sport to watch for the youth. It all changed with new owners Liberty Media and their idea of Netflix's 'Drive to Survive'\n\nHindu Mahasangh, a Maharashtra-based organisation, has protested against some scenes in 'Phule' trailer. Anand Dave, the outfit's president, said it is unfair to only \"highlight the not-so-good things\" about the Brahmin community.\n\nEver tried a blush called 'Orgasm'? Or a mascara that struts its stuff with the moniker, 'Better than Sex'? Sex sells. Brands know that all too well. Even if that means reducing women to mere sex objects.\n\nApril 14, 2025, is the 135th birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar, also called Babasaheb Ambedkar, who is hailed as 'the father of the Indian Constitution'.\n\nThe erosion of trust in US treasury bonds could have seismic consequences."
