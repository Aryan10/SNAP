        "content": "A US judgeruledGoogle acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in some ad tech. This is the second time a judge ruled Google willfully engaged in monopolistic practices.  The remedies for these rulings are still being worked out but may strengthen the case to have Google's business broken up.\n\nThe 115 pagePDF court documentconcluded, \"Google has willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive\n\nacts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets\n\nfor open-web display advertising.\"\n\nGoogle quickly responded onXsaying, \"we won half of this case and we will appeal the other half\" of the US antitrust ruling, and \"we disagree\" with the decision on its publisher tools.\n\nHere is the full conclusion written by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia:\n\nPlaintiffs have proven that Google has willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive\n\nacts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets\n\nfor open-web display advertising. For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and\n\nad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled\n\nthe company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets. Google further\n\nentrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and\n\neliminating desirable product features. In addition to depriving rivals of the ability to compete, this exclusionary conduct substantially harmed Google\u2019s publisher customers, the competitive\n\nprocess, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web. Accordingly, Google is\n\nliable under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, by an Order to be issued with this Memorandum Opinion,\n\nCount III (monopolization of the advertiser ad network market) will be dismissed, and the parties\n\nwill be ordered to submit a joint proposed schedule for briefing and arguing their positions as to\n\nthe remedies that should be imposed in light of Google have been found liable for\n\nmonopolization of the publisher ad server market (Count I), monopolization of the ad exchange\n\nmarket (Count II), and unlawful tying of AdX and DFP (Count IV).\n\nLast August,Google also was ruled a monopoly, which we covered.\n\nThere are a number ofremediesbeing explored over these rulings. According toAxios, The DOJ and 17 US states that brought the antitrust case seek to force Google to sell off its \"network\" ad business, which is about 12% of Alphabet's total revenue.\n\nThe ruling goes on to read:\n\nGoogle evolved from a garage-based startup to a multitrillion dollar company in little\n\nmore than twenty years. Much of that growth was funded by digital advertising. In keeping with\n\nits professed mission to \u201corganize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and\n\nuseful,\u201d Google provides many of its key services at no financial cost to Internet users.\n\nOver the past two decades, Google has established increasingly detailed knowledge about the billions of people who have used its products, including by collecting data pertaining to their web browsing, search activity, physical location, demographic characteristics, app usage, communications, shopping activity, and device and network information.\n\nIn sum, Plaintiffs have shown that Google engaged in \u201cwillful acquisition or maintenance\n\nof [its monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a\n\nsuperior product, business acumen, or historic accident\u201d by tying DFP to AdX and committing a\n\nseries of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts to entrench its monopoly power in two adjacent\n\nproduct markets. Kodak, 504 U.S. at 481 (quoting Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 570\u201371). The\n\nprocompetitive justifications that Google proffers for its anticompetitive conduct are both invalid\n\nand insufficient, and any procompetitive benefits of this conduct were far outweighed by its\n\nanticompetitive effects. Therefore, Google cannot evade liability under Sections 1 and 2 of the\n\nSherman Act.\n\nIt looks even more evil:\n\nGoogle\u2019s internal messaging application deleted records of chats between employees\n\nunless an employee explicitly turned on \u201cchat history,\u201d and the application\u2019s user interface made\n\nit difficult for employees to turn on chat history for every conversation they had. Chat deletions occurred when employees discussed substantive topics at issue in this litigation and continued after the federal government began an antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s conduct.\n\nGoogle employees and executives also misused the attorney-client privilege.\n\nGoogle\u2019s systemic disregard of the evidentiary rules regarding spoliation of evidence and\n\nits misuse of the attorney-client privilege may well be sanctionable.\n\nThis is a big deal and a lot of the folks in our industry were waiting for this to drop.\n\nAgain, what will these rulings lead to exactly is still not known.\n\nHere is the first thing I saw Google respond with so far:\n\n\u201cWe won half of this case and we will appeal the other half. The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don\u2019t harm competition. We disagree with the Court\u2019s decision regarding our publisher tools.
