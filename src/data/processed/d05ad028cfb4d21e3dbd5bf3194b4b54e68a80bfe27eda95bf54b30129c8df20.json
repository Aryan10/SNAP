  "summary": "A CUNY SPH study reveals concerning public attitudes toward bird flu prevention. Survey results show many Americans lack awareness of food safety practices and are reluctant to take preventive measures. Political affiliation and geography significantly influence willingness to accept public health recommendations, with Republicans and rural residents showing more resistance to vaccination and dietary modifications.",
  "content": "In an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers from the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy warn that public ignorance and apathy towards bird flu could obstruct virus containment efforts and lead to a larger public health crisis.\n\nA population representative survey conducted in August 2024 revealed concerning gaps in public knowledge. Over half of respondents were unaware that pasteurized milk is safer than raw milk, though 71.3% understood that high-temperature cooking eliminates harmful pathogens like H5N1.\n\n27% of respondents expressed unwillingness to modify their diet to reduce virus exposure risk, while 28.7% were reluctant to take a potential H5N1 vaccine even with CDC recommendation. Republicans and Independents showed significantly less support for preventive measures compared to Democrats.\n\nRural Americans, particularly those near livestock industries, demonstrated lower acceptance of public health measures than urban residents. Lead author Piltch-Loeb emphasizes the need for targeted health communications strategies based on political and geographic differences.\n\nHealth communications expert Kenneth Rabin notes the importance of collaborating with agricultural leaders and farming communities, while highlighting concerns about tracking infections among undocumented agricultural workers at risk of exposure.",

        "content": "In an editorial in theAmerican Journal of Public Health, a team led by researchers from the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH) say public ignorance and apathy towards bird flu (highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI) could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a larger-scale public health crisis.\n\nThe authors, including CUNY SPH Assistant Professor Rachael Piltch-Loeb, Associate Professor Katarzyna Wyka, Professor Jeffrey V. Lazarus, Senior Scholar Kenneth Rabin, Distinguished Lecturer Scott C. Ratzan, and Dean Ayman El-Mohandes, conducted a population representative survey of U.S. residents from August 5 to 15, 2024, which used an in-depth sampling framework and intentional oversampling of rural populations.\n\nThe results suggest many respondents were unaware of simple food safety practices that could reduce the risk of HPAI infection. Over half (53.7%) did not know that pasteurized milk is safer than raw milk, although almost three of four respondents (71.3%) did understand that cooking meat at high temperatures could eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses like H5N1.\n\nOver a quarter (27%) of respondents said they were unwilling to modify their diet to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, and more than one in four respondents (28.7%) expressed reluctance to take a potential vaccine for H5N1, even if advised by the CDC to do so.\n\nParticipants who described themselves as Republicans or Independents were significantly less likely than Democrats to support either vaccination or dietary modifications.\n\nRural Americans, many of whom are more likely to work or live in or near livestock industries, were less likely to accept public health measures, including vaccination and dietary changes, compared to their urban counterparts.\n\n\"These attitudes could pose a serious obstacle to containing the virus and preventing a major public health crisis,\" says Piltch-Loeb, the study's lead author. \"The fact that responses vary significantly by political party and geography emphasizes the need for a carefully segmented health communications strategy to address the issue.\"\n\nRabin, who has been engaged in health communications campaigns for more than four decades, adds that, \"Working closely with agricultural leaders, farm communities and food processing companies will be critical, and the fact that most of the agricultural workers who are at direct risk of exposure to the bird flu virus may be undocumented could seriously jeopardize efforts to track and control the spread of infections.\"\n\nCUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2025.308080\n\nPosted in:Disease/Infection News|Healthcare News\n\nCancel reply to comment\n\nRafael E.
