If the FTC\u2019s lawyers prevail, the trial could potentially require Meta to spin out Instagram or WhatsApp as separate companies.\n\nNotably, Zuckerberg admitted on Wednesday that TikTok\u2019s arrival had directly impacted Meta, saying his company had observed that its \u201cgrowth slowed down dramatically\u201d when TikTok became popular. He also said the ByteDance-owned app has continued to be a focus of Meta\u2019s competitive efforts for several years.\n\nByteDancepurchasedMusical.ly in 2017, andmergedit with TikTok the following year. Around the same time, Meta (then known as Facebook)stopped reporting Facebook\u2019s user numbersin its quarterly reports, shifting to a new \u201cfamily of apps\u201d metric that encompassed Instagram and WhatsApp. The change was designed to hide the fact that Meta\u2019s flagship app was seeing slowing growth.\n\nZuckerberg made another interesting comment during the trial in response to a question about social media platforms\u2019 \u201cnetwork effects.\u201d He said it\u2019s become less important for social media apps to leverage connections between friends and family to grow.\n\n\u201cThe apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,\u201d Zuckerberg told the court. \u201cPeople can take that content to messaging engines.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, however, Facebook is trying to return to its \u201cOG roots\u201dby turning once again to those network effects. The company recently released new features designed to make it easier to connect with friends, includinga revamped Friends tabthat highlights friend requests and activity. In January, Zuckerberg told investors that a \u201creturn to OG Facebook\u201d was a key goal for 2025.\n\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Editor\n\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.
