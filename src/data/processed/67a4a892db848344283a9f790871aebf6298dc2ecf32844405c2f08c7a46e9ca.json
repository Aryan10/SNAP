  "summary": "A global study reveals that common genetic variants in CNIH3 and WDR26 genes may explain drug resistance in focal epilepsy patients. Researchers from UCL and UTHealth Houston analyzed data from 6,826 epilepsy patients, finding that these variants increase the risk of drug resistance and influence response to antiseizure medications. This discovery could help predict treatment outcomes earlier.",
  "content": "Certain common genetic changes may explain why some people with focal epilepsy become less responsive to seizure medications, finds a new global study.\n\nFocal epilepsy is a condition where seizures start in one part of the brain. It is the most common type of epilepsy. Antiseizure medication is usually prescribed for people with the condition. However, for one in three people with epilepsy (around 20 million individuals worldwide), current antiseizure medications are ineffective.
