This move follows a probe by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) into Gensol Engineering, raising serious questions about BluSmart\u2019s viability.\n\nAlso read:Gensol crisis: BluSmart suspends cab bookings via app in parts of NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru\n\nMeanwhile, Refex Green Mobility Ltd (RGML), a subsidiary of Refex Industries, has confirmed that it is streamlining its operations in Bengaluru by phasing out its airport-based EV taxi services. These services were run via Refex EV Fleet Services. \u201cThe move aims to focus on scaling electric mobility solutions for enterprise and institutional clients through long-term partnerships and stable demand,\u201d the company said.\n\nInterestingly, both Refex and BluSmart have a linkage. Earlier this year, Refex Green Mobility had announced a Rs 315 crore deal to acquire 2,997 electric vehicles from Gensol Engineering, with plans to lease them to BluSmart. However, Refex later withdrew the proposal, citing \u201cevolving commitments\u201d on both sides.\n\nAlso read:Refex Green withdraws plan to takeover Gensol's 3,000 EVs, cites 'challenges' to conclude deal\n\nTravellers hit\n\nKempegowda International Airport handled 41.88 million travellers in the last financial year, up from 37.53 million the previous year\u2014an 11.6 percent increase. Despite this growth, the availability of airport cabs continues to be a challenge, with frequent complaints of long waits and inadequate fleets at the designated Ola-Uber pick-up zones.\n\nBangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL), which operates KIA, was unavailable to comment.\n\nAlso read:BluSmart takes on Uber, Ola, launches cab pickup zone at Bengaluru airport\n\nSources said the exit of both Refex and BluSmart is likely to compound the shortage. \u201cBIAL tied up with Refex and commenced services in June 2024. They had also introduced pink taxis driven by women, exclusively for female passengers. BIAL had ended partnerships with earlier operators like Meru and Mega in favour of Refex. Now, with both Refex and BluSmart halting operations, it\u2019s causing inconvenience to passengers,\u201d a source said.\n\nAnother source added that airport taxis operated through BIAL\u2019s official 'BLR Pulse' mobile application were mostly linked to Refex, which had a 100 percent electric fleet. \"Many passengers who couldn't find cabs via Ola and Uber relied on BluSmart and Refex, and are now the most affected. These services were also environmentally friendly,\" the source added.\n\nIn March 2023, BluSmart Mobility launched a dedicated cab pickup zone at Bengaluru airport, following Ola and Uber. Other aggregators like Rapido, Namma Yatri, QuickRide and Shoffr do not have a dedicated pickup zone at the airport. However, dedicated airport taxi services such as Refex and KSTDC are allowed to pick up passengers directly in front of the terminals.\n\nHowever, a BIAL official said that passengers can continue to book rides through Ola, Uber, Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC), WTi rental cabs, as well as BMTC\u2019s Vayu Vajra and KSRTC\u2019s inter-city Flybus services.\n\nIn a statement, Refex said: \u201cRefex continues to offer high-quality mobility services through its integrated B2B and B2B2C EV platform, featuring company-owned EVs, trained driver partners, and a tech-driven operations framework. Since its launch in March 2023 with 24 vehicles, Refex\u2019s Green Mobility vertical has grown to nearly 1,300 EVs. We serve Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Mumbai across use cases such as employee transport, corporate rentals, airport transfers, and partnerships with leading ride-hailing platforms.\u201d\n\nAlso read:Bengaluru airport launches electric taxis for passengers\n\nDiscover the latestBusiness News,Budget 2025 News,Sensex, andNiftyupdates.
