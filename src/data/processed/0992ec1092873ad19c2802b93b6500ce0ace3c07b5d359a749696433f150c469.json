  "summary": "House Select Committee on China released an investigative report exposing Chinese AI platform DeepSeek as a national security threat. The report reveals DeepSeek transfers American user data to the CCP, spreads propaganda, and uses unauthorized U.S. AI model data. Committee leaders demand answers from Nvidia regarding chip sales potentially violating export controls.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI) and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on China released a new investigative report exposing DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence platform, as a serious national security threat to the United States.\n\nThe bipartisan report titled \"DeepSeek Unmasked: Exposing the CCP's Latest Tool For Spying, Stealing, and Subverting U.S. Export Control Restrictions\" reveals that DeepSeek covertly funnels American user data to the Chinese Communist Party, manipulates information to align with CCP propaganda, and was trained using material unlawfully obtained from U.S. AI models. The report also highlights that DeepSeek operates on tens of thousands of Nvidia chips\u2014some of which are subject to U.S. export controls.\n\nChairman Moolenaar stated that DeepSeek is a weapon in the Chinese Communist Party's arsenal, designed to spy on Americans, steal technology, and subvert U.S. law. In response to the findings, the Select Committee has sent a formal letter to Nvidia demanding answers about sales to China and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Committee will continue investigating how American innovation is being exploited by the Chinese Communist Party and will work to ensure that U.S. companies are not enabling the CCP's efforts to undermine national security.",

The report also\u00a0highlights reporting\u00a0that DeepSeek operates on tens of thousands of Nvidia chips\u2014some of which are subject to U.S. export controls.\n\n\"This report makes it clear: DeepSeek isn\u2019t just another AI app \u2014 it\u2019s a weapon in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s arsenal, designed to spy on Americans, steal our technology, and subvert U.S. law,\"said Chairman Moolenaar.\"We now know this tool exploited U.S. AI models and reportedly used advanced Nvidia chips that should never have ended up in CCP hands. That\u2019s why we\u2019re sending a letter to Nvidia to demand answers. American innovation should never be the engine of our adversaries\u2019 ambitions.\"\n\nKey findings include:\n\nIn response to the report\u2019s findings, the Select Committee has sent aformal letterto Nvidia demanding answers\u00a0about sales to China and Southeast Asia to examine whether and\u00a0how its chips ended up powering DeepSeek\u2019s AI models\u2014despite U.S. export restrictions.\n\nThe Committee will continue investigating how American innovation is being exploited by the Chinese Communist Party and will work to ensure that U.S. companies are not enabling the CCP\u2019s efforts to undermine our national security.\n\nRead the full report:DeepSeek Unmasked: Exposing the CCP\u2019s Latest Tool For Spying, Stealing, and Subverting U.S. Export Control Restrictions\n\n###"
