        "content": "From courtrooms to concert halls to artistic powerhouses, this year\u2019sTIME100list of 100 most influential people features a host of women who are making history and shaping the future. Here\u2019s a closer look at some of the most remarkable women honoured this year, in the words of those who know them best.\n\nIn the face of devastating trauma,Gis\u00e8le Pelicotdid what many couldn\u2019t: she stood tall, named her abuser in open court, and refused to be silenced. Her husband, along with dozens of accomplices, was convicted in a landmark trial that not only delivered justice but disrupted deep-rooted silence around sexual violence.\n\nHer strength reverberated far beyond France. \u201cJust as Gandhi challenged racial violence in India, Gis\u00e8le has challenged the patriarchy everywhere,\u201d wrote Gloria Steinem, the writer, political activist, and feminist organiser.\n\n\u201cThere have been tributes to Gis\u00e8le in many countries. She is a symbol of strength and survival, she is a source of inspiration for women and for humane men, wherever we live. Gis\u00e8le has shown us the way. Now we must follow,\u201d she concluded.\n\nScarlett Johanssonhas spent more than two decades redefining what a leading lady looks like. From intimate indie films to billion-dollar blockbusters, she\u2019s always chosen her own path.\n\nChris Evans, who\u2019s known her since they were teenagers on set, calls her \u201ca pioneer, a rebel, a force,\u201d and above all, someone \u201cunafraid to be vulnerable\u2026 unafraid to be herself.\u201d\n\nEvans notes, \u201cDespite her being three years younger than me, I\u2019ve always considered Scarlett Johansson my older sister. We met in 2002 while filmingThe Perfect Scorein Vancouver. Even at 17, she had wisdom, talent, and grit beyond her years.\u201d\n\nEvans looked up to her as any younger sibling would, \u201cwith equal parts admiration and intimidation.\u201d Having seen her seamlessly transition between independent and mainstream films, refusing to be typecast, Evans wrote that Johansson has proven herself as one of the most \u201cbankable actors of her generation.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a living testament to the power of fearlessness in art. That\u2019s why even though I\u2019m older, I learn from her, I lean on her, and I look up to her. And as any \u2018younger\u2019 sibling would assert, there\u2019s absolutely nothing she can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nForget the red carpets,Blake Livelyis doing her most meaningful work far from the spotlight, according to Sherrilyn Ifill, a civil rights lawyer. \u201cThe Blake Lively I know is a philanthropist and a student of our country\u2019s most intractable problems. She and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, reached out in 2019 to contribute to the NAACP Legal Defence Fund,\u201d wrote Ifill.\n\nIfill immediately admired Lively\u2019s curiosity and her work to understand the conditions that shape her country. \u201cI remember an early conversation in which she expressed frustration that so much of our nation\u2019s history was not part of the instruction she had received as a student. Her commitment to filling those gaps \u2014 and becoming the most fully informed and prepared citizen \u2014 is what I appreciate most about her,\u201d added Ifill.\n\nShe concluded by calling Lively a \u201cserious person\u201d and a \u201crisk taker,\u201d who\u2019s committed to moving her country forward for children.\n\nRos\u00e9isn\u2019t just a member of BLACKPINK, she\u2019s an entire vibe, according to actor Lilly Collins. With a distinct voice and magnetic stage presence, she\u2019s captivated millions. Yet behind the stardom is someone deeply grounded.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the definition of an icon and a boss,\u201d wrote Collins. \u201cI\u2019ve come to learn that not only is Ros\u00e9 really genuine and down-to-earth, but she\u2019s also a total badass. She\u2019s such a dynamic performer and songwriter, and I think it\u2019s incredible that she\u2019s able to captivate arenas full of people as both a member of the biggest girl group in the world and also as a solo artist.\u201d\n\nCollins admired her humour, energy, voice, spirit and, \u201creally, everything about her. I\u2019m so proud of all the things she\u2019s done in the past year, and I feel so lucky to call her a friend.\u201d\n\nEven after hanging up her tennis racquet,Serena Williamshasn\u2019t slowed down. She\u2019s investing in women-led businesses, backing WNBA expansion teams, and proving that athleticism and entrepreneurship go hand in hand.\n\nFellow Olympian Allyson Felix wrote about Williams\u2019 comeback after a life-threatening childbirth gave her strength during her own. \u201cShe could take a break\u2026 Instead, she continues to pave the way. A win for her is a win for all of us.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 perseverance inspired Felix\u2019s own comeback story. \u201cAfter an unexpectedly difficult pregnancy that required an emergency C-section and a lengthy recovery, I returned to the track to win two medals \u2014 a gold and a bronze \u2014 at the Tokyo Olympics.\u201d\n\nFelix notes that Williams continues to be impactful even away from professional tennis. \u201cWhether it\u2019s through her venture-capital fund that invests in companies founded by women and people of colour, or joining the ownership group of the Toronto Tempo, a WNBA expansion team, or dancing during halftime at the Super Bowl, she continues to show that we, as athletes, are so far from one-dimensional.\u201d\n\nThese five women are just a glimpse of the wider list. Also celebrated this year are trailblazers likeIsmahane Elouafi,Bonnie Y Chan,Teresa Ribera, andMo Abudu, among many others.\n\nCompunode.com Pvt. Ltd. (www.compunode.com).Designed forDawn."
