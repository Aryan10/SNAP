  "summary": "Indian farmers face increasing challenges as monsoon patterns become more unpredictable, affecting agricultural production across the country. The annual monsoon season, traditionally running from June to September, is crucial for India's agriculture but climate change is making rainfall more erratic.",
  "content": "BENGALURU, India (AP) \u2014 Each year from June to September, a heavy band of rain makes its way from India's southwest coast to its northeastern borders, quenching farmers' thirsty fields.\n\nIndia's monsoon season is arguably the single most important weather pattern affecting the lives and livelihoods of the country's 1.4 billion people. The rains provide about 75% of India's annual rainfall and help grow crops that feed hundreds of millions.\n\nBut as climate change intensifies, these rains are becoming increasingly erratic, scientists say. Some years see too much rain, others too little. The unpredictability of the monsoons poses immense challenges for Indian farmers, who must adapt their growing practices while contending with both floods and droughts.\n\nExperts suggest solutions ranging from switching to drought-resistant crop varieties to implementing advanced irrigation systems. However, many small-scale farmers lack the resources to make such changes. Government initiatives are working to provide support, but the scale of the challenge remains daunting.",
