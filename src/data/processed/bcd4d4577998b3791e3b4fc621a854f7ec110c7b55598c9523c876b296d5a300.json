  "summary": "A new meta-analysis suggests that adding high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays to conventional risk-prediction methods could improve primary cardiovascular disease prevention. The CAPRICE study, analyzing data from over 62,000 adults, found that both troponin T and I tests could help identify patients who might benefit from statin therapy, potentially preventing one CVD event per approximately 400-500 individuals screened.",

        "content": "Adding high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays on top of conventional risk-prediction methods can potentially improve primary prevention efforts, according to a new meta-analysis.\n\nWhile best known for their ability to rule out or diagnose MI, these assays also can quantify very low concentrations of cardiac troponin T and I in otherwise healthy people. Authors of the study,publishedin the April 15, 2025, issue of theJournal of the American College of Cardiology, say that there may be room for the tests in routine blood draws, especially for patients who are potential candidates for statin therapy.\n\nTheir argument is akin to \u201crepurposing\u201d troponin assays given that they\u2019re already accessible and relatively affordable, said Spencer J. Keene, PhD (University of Cambridge, England), joint first author of the paper along with Anoop S.V. Shah, MD, PhD (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, England).\n\n\u201cWe can now use them potentially for prognosis,\u201d Keene told TCTMD, adding that the data \u201csupport maybe more use and also educating clinicians about using them in a different way.\u201d\n\nInformation from a high-sensitivity troponin assay wouldn\u2019t necessarily change treatment plans for patients already deemed high risk by conventional tools, but it could change the course for those at low or intermediate risk, Keene said. \u201cWe would still probably prefer that the high-risk group gets statins,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe first step is that people should use risk-prediction models to support their decision-making, and then the next step would be looking at these add-on factors that could also support decision-making if there\u2019s some uncertainty.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the findings for TCTMD, Nicholas Marston, MD (Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, MA), agreed that there is \u201cless utility\u201d for troponin assays in patients who already meet indications for statin therapy. Butcurrent guidelines, he said, support the use of \u201crisk enhancers to help guide that discussion and make a decision about statins. Currently those are high-sensitivity CRP, eGFR for chronic kidney disease, [and] family history of early heart disease\u2014these might be things that kind of push you over to starting statins in a patient. And I think high-sensitivity troponins could be one of those as well.\u201d\n\nCAPRICE Data\n\nThe CAPRICE study included data from 62,150 adults (mean age 61 years; 48.5% women) without known CVD from 15 prospective longitudinal cohorts. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) was measured in 50,523 participants from 11 studies, while high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) was used in 28,090 participants from six studies, with median concentrations of those two biomarkers recorded as 5.0 and 3.3 ng/L, respectively.\n\nOver a median follow-up of 11.8 years for the hs-cTnT and 9.8 years for the hs-cTnI groups, 16.1% and13.3% of patients, respectively, had first onset CVD primary outcome events\u2014coronary heart disease or stroke. The risk for these events grew with each standard deviation higher concentration of hs-cTnT (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.25-1.37) and hs-cTnI (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.19-1.33).\n\nMoreover, adding troponin assays to conventional risk factors increased overall predictive accuracy. Using incidence rates from 2.1 million adults from the United Kingdom, the researchers estimated that hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI screening would prevent one additional CVD event for every 408 and 473 individuals without known CVD, respectively, based on reclassifying them to high risk and starting statin therapy.\n\nKeene said he was surprised to see that both troponin assays similarly improved risk prediction, though hs-cTnT had a \u201cslight advantage\u201d over hs-cTnI. \u200aThere has been \u201csome controversyaround whether or not troponin I or troponin T is better,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think a lot of clinicians prefer troponin I and thought that it was a better prognostic marker than troponin T, and we essentially found that they\u2019re either similar or even that troponin T is better.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Keene argued in favor of more routine use of high-sensitivity troponins in primary prevention, but still thinks it\u2019s worth initiating statins among patients whose risk might be down-classified by troponins. \u201cI\u200adon\u2019t think there\u2019s enough evidence that troponins should be used to deny statins to people who are high risk,\u201d he said.\n\nThe biggest challenges in the way of that approach right now include physician awareness and also cost barriers in lower-resourced areas, Keene said, adding that he\u2019d like to see other studies confirm their findings and look at cost-effectiveness.\n\n\u2018Significant Mindset Shift\u2019\n\nIn an accompanyingeditorial, Cian P. McCarthy, MBBCh (Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and colleagues write that the CAPRICE results \u201csuggest incorporating hs-cTn into CVD risk-based primary treatment allocation has value both with respect to increasing the number of CVD events that may be prevented and, potentially, reducing overtreatment among individuals less likely to derive benefit.\u201d\n\nHowever, this will necessitate a \u201csignificant mindset shift for clinicians\u201d who typically think of troponin assays as tools for MI diagnosis, they add.\n\nMarston agreed, noting that his institutional software will prompt him with a warning when he tries to order a high-sensitivity troponin assay in a stable patient. While this alert is designed to call attention to patients who should not be treated in an outpatient clinic and instead transferred to the emergency department, it\u2019s one example of a workflow change that might be needed for these tests to be more widely accepted outside of acute settings.\n\nMoving forward, he\u2019d like to see studies demonstrate that, for example, patients with higher troponin levels also derive greater benefit from statin therapy. \u201cPhysicians really want to see that it can impact management and patient outcomes,\u201d as theJUPITERtrial did for high sensitivity C-reactive protein, Marston added.\n\nYael L.
