Please check your inbox to confirm.\n\nPaul Wiseman, Associated PressPaul Wiseman, Associated Press\n\nLeave your feedback\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tariffs are in the news at the moment. Here\u2019s what they are and what you need to know about them.\n\nTariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country.\n\nREAD MORE:A timeline of Trump\u2019s tariff actions so far\n\nU.S. tariff rates vary: They are generally 2.5 percent on passenger cars, for instance, and 6 percent on golf shoes. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. Before the U.S. began imposing 25 percent tariffs on good from Canada and Mexico as of Tuesday, most goods moved between the United States and those countries tariff-free because of President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n\nMainstream economists are generally skeptical about tariffs, considering them an inefficient way for governments to raise revenue.\n\nTrump is a proponent of tariffs, insisting that they are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, it is importers \u2014 American companies \u2014 that pay tariffs, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Those companies typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That\u2019s why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs.\n\nREAD MORE:How soon will prices rise? 4 questions about Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, answered\n\nStill, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices \u2014 and sacrifice profits \u2014 to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump has said tariffs will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare.\n\n\u201cTariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,\u2019\u2019 Trump said at a rally in Flint, Michigan, during his presidential campaign.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs with a flourish \u2014 targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China.\n\nWATCH:Trump announces broad tariffs at \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 White House event\n\n\u201cTariff Man,\u201d he called himself.\n\nTrump is moving ahead with higher tariffs in his second term.\n\nThe United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That\u2019s generally a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered tree trade and and China\u2019s ascent as a manufacturing power.\n\nBy raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices such as subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices.\n\nBefore the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue source for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90 percent of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy.\n\nWATCH:Senate passes resolution to undo Trump\u2019s Canada tariffs in rare Republican rebuke\n\nTariffs fell out of favor as global trade grew after World War II. The government needed vastly bigger revenue streams to finance its operations.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government collected around $80 billion in tariffs and fees, a trifle next to the $2.5 trillion that comes from individual income taxes and the $1.7 trillion from Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n\nStill, Trump favors a budget policy that resembles what was in place in the 19th century.\n\nTariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States.\n\nTrump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars.\n\nWATCH:A look inside Canada\u2019s last-minute efforts to avert Trump\u2019s steep tariffs\n\n\u201cI can do it with a phone call,\u201d he said at an August rally in North Carolina.\n\nIf another country tries to start a war, he said he\u2019d issue a threat:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to charge you 100 percent tariffs. And all of a sudden, the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, \u2018Sir, we won\u2019t go to war.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. They\u2019re also likely to provoke retaliation.\n\nThe European Union, for example, punched back against Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China has responded to Trump\u2019s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country.\n\nA study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump\u2019s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \u201cneither raised nor lowered U.S. employment\u2019\u2019 where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found.\n\nREAD MORE:Dow tumbles more than 1,600 the day after Trump\u2019s major tariff announcement\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States.\n\nWorse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \u201cnegative employment impacts,\u2019\u2019 especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. The study found that support for Trump and Republican congressional candidates rose in areas most exposed to the import tariffs \u2014 the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nYour tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.
