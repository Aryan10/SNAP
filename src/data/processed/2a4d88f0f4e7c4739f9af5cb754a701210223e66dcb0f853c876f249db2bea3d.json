The research, released in April 2025, examines how specific fatty compounds in everyday cooking oils may influence cancer cell growth and progression.\n\nWhile detailed findings were not specified in the source, the study appears to focus on the relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer risk, particularly regarding more aggressive forms of the disease.
