  "summary": "NASA is developing an advanced quantum sensor called the Quantum Gravity Gradiometer Pathfinder for low Earth orbit that can detect minute changes in Earth's gravity. The compact device uses clouds of atoms cooled to near absolute zero to measure gravitational changes with extreme precision, potentially enabling mapping of underground features like aquifers and mineral deposits.",
  "content": "Scientists are developing an advanced quantum sensor for low Earth orbit that can detect the tiniest tremors in Earth's gravity. These barely perceptible shifts \u2014 caused by moving water, tectonic activity or shifting rock \u2014 offer clues about what lies beneath the planet's surface.\n\nThe new device could allow the mapping of underground features like aquifers and mineral deposits \u2014 crucial data for navigation, resource management and national security, its developers say.\n\nQuantum sensors, like the Quantum Gravity Gradiometer Pathfinder (QGGPf) instrument developed by JPL, private companies and academic institutions, use clouds of atoms dropped in freefall and cooled to near absolute zero. As they fall, lasers act like mirrors and splitters, separating the atoms and then bringing them back together. The way the atoms interfere when they recombine reveals how much they were accelerated by gravity, allowing scientists to measure the tiniest changes in gravity with extreme precision.\n\nBecause it uses atoms instead of bulky mechanical parts, the QGGPf sensor is surprisingly compact \u2014 about the size of a small washing machine \u2014 and weighs just 275 pounds (125 kilograms). That makes it much smaller and lighter than traditional space-based gravity instruments.\n\nNASA plans to give the new sensor an in-space test near the end of the decade. The technology demonstration mission will put a suite of cutting-edge tools to the test, pushing the limits of how light and atoms interact at the smallest scales.",
