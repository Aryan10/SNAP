  "summary": "A study of 400,000 older adults shows regular smartphone and internet use correlates with slower cognitive decline. CT scans may be responsible for 5% of U.S. cancer cases annually due to radiation exposure. Research also indicates e-cigarette use increases risks of COPD and potential hypertension, though traditional cigarettes pose greater health risks.",
  "content": "Older adults who regularly use smartphones, computers or the internet demonstrated slower rates of cognitive decline, according to an analysis of more than 400,000 people over 50. Published in Nature Human Behavior, the study found no support for the idea of \"digital dementia\" and suggests that mentally active, socially connected technology use may benefit cognitive health.\n\nA new study in JAMA Internal Medicine estimates that CT scans could account for 103,000 U.S. cancer diagnoses annually \u2014 about 5% of all cases \u2014 due to radiation exposure from the 93 million scans performed each year. Researchers urge more careful use of imaging and dose optimization, especially for low-value or unnecessary scans.\n\nA Johns Hopkins-led analysis of nearly 250,000 adults found exclusive e-cigarette use to be associated with a higher risk of developing COPD and, in adults aged 30-70, a slightly increased risk of hypertension. Published in Nicotine & Tobacco Research, the study adds to growing evidence of vaping's health risks \u2014 though use of traditional cigarettes remains more strongly linked to chronic disease.",

Published in *Nature Human Behavior*, the study found no evidence supporting \"digital dementia\" concerns. Instead, findings suggest that mentally engaging and socially connected technology use may support cognitive health.\\n\\n## Medical Imaging Risks\\nA new study in *JAMA Internal Medicine* reveals CT scans may be responsible for approximately 103,000 U.S. cancer diagnoses annually\u2014roughly 5% of all cases. This risk stems from radiation exposure across the 93 million scans performed yearly. Researchers advocate for:\\n* More selective use of imaging\\n* Optimization of radiation doses\\n* Reduction of low-value or unnecessary scans\\n\\n## E-Cigarette Health Impacts\\nA comprehensive Johns Hopkins-led study analyzing nearly 250,000 adults has identified new health risks associated with vaping. Published in *Nicotine & Tobacco Research*, the findings show:\\n* Exclusive e-cigarette users face elevated COPD risk\\n* Adults aged 30-70 show slightly increased hypertension risk\\n* Traditional cigarettes still pose greater chronic disease risks overall"
