Russia proposed adding the words \u201cincluding by addressing its root causes\u201d to the third paragraph (on a swift end to the conflict).\n\nThe EU proposed adding some of the language in the Ukrainian resolution, referring to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation (rather than the Russian Federation-Ukraine conflict), the \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d of Ukraine and calling for a peace in line with theUN Charter.\n\nWhen it came to the vote, Ukraine\u2019s version passed by 93 votes to 18. The US voted against, alongside Russia, marking a major shift of its position on the conflict and previous votes.\n\nThe US\u00a0supported asimilar resolutionsubmitted in February\u00a02023 which received 141\u00a0votes in favour.\n\nA total of 65 nations abstained, including South Africa, whose representative, Ambassador Mathu Joyini, said the draft \u201cdoes not go far enough in terms of inclusivity and creating a positive momentum towards a peaceful negotiation\u201d.\n\nThe US version was also adopted (93 in favour, eight against and 73 abstentions), but Member States also voted to add the European Union amendments with 60 in favour, 18 against and 81 abstentions.\n\nThe US voted against the amendments and abstained on its own resolution (the General Assembly failed to adopt the Russian amendment, with 31 in favour, 71 against and 59 abstentions).\n\nUkraine\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa told the Assembly that the way Russian aggression is answered \u201cwill define the future of Ukraine\u2026Europe and our common future\u201d.\n\nLater, flanked by co-sponsors of the country\u2019s General Assembly resolution, shedelivered a statementat the media stakeout just outside the Security Council Chamber. She said the General Assembly had demanded \u201can early end to this war of aggression and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine, in line with the UN Charter\u201d.\n\nThe General Assembly\u2019s reaffirmation of support for international law and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity was profoundly important, she said, warning that a peace deal that \u201crisks rewarding aggression increases the risk\u201d and creates a dangerous precedent for the future.\n\nAttention turned to the Security Council in the afternoon, where a vote was due to be held on theUnited Statesresolution.\n\nAs before, there were attempts to add amendments supported by several western European countries, referring to a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d by Russia and Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, andproposalsfrom Russia to acknowledge the \u201cdeeply rooted reasons\u201d for the conflict and lasting peace in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nBut, the amendments were voted down and the resolution was passed without any changes by the 15-member Council (10 in favour, none against and five abstentions).\n\nSpeaking after the vote, US Ambassador Dorothy Shea said Washington sincerely appreciated Council members\u2019 support saying that it \u201cputs us on the path to peace\u201d.\n\nAfter a pause in proceedings, Rosemary DiCarlo, the head of UN Political Affairs, briefed the 15 Council members on the current situation in Ukraine.\n\nShe said that the Russian invasion \u201cundermined the very foundations of the international order\u201d and reminded delegates that, since 24 February 2022, at least 12,654 Ukrainian civilians, including 673 children, have been killed.\n\nReferring to the Security Council resolution adopted earlier in the Council, Ms. DiCarlo insisted that peace in Ukraine must be \u201cjust, sustainable and comprehensive, in line with the Charter of the United Nations, international law and resolutions of the General Assembly\u201d, including those adopted on Monday morning during the General Assembly emergency special session.\n\nFind out more in our comprehensivelive coverage of the day here.\n\nFacebookTwitterPrintEmail"
