  "summary": "A seasoned traveler shares their favorite underrated American cities after visiting all 50 states. The list includes Colorado Springs, Chattanooga, St. Louis, Fort Worth, Savannah, Santa Fe, and Louisville. Each city offers unique attractions, from outdoor activities to cultural experiences, often overshadowed by their more famous neighboring cities.",
  "content": "After a decade of solo travel across all 50 states, certain cities have emerged as unexpected favorites that often fly under the radar compared to popular destinations like New York City or Los Angeles.\n\nColorado Springs, though overshadowed by Denver and Boulder, offers limitless outdoor activities, Rocky Mountain access, and a thriving food scene. The historic Broadmoor Resort, Pikes Peak cog railway, and Garden of the Gods are notable attractions.\n\nChattanooga, Tennessee, situated between Nashville and Atlanta, is a haven for outdoor recreation featuring Lookout Mountain and Ruby Falls, the nation's tallest underground waterfall. The downtown area boasts art, shops, museums, and a vibrant riverfront.\n\nSt. Louis, despite being overshadowed by Chicago and Kansas City, offers numerous free attractions including the excellent St. Louis Zoo, The Science Center, Gateway Arch National Park, and Grant's Farm.\n\nFort Worth provides a more authentic Texan experience than Dallas, with Sundance Square's retail and arts scene, the Near Southside district's culture, and the historic Stockyards featuring cattle drives and rodeos.\n\nSavannah, while similar to Charleston and New Orleans, has its own charm with 22 unique town squares, classic Southern food, cobblestone River Street, and nearby Tybee Island.\n\nSanta Fe showcases strong Spanish influences through its art, history, culture, and cuisine. The Plaza, Canyon Road art galleries, and Museum Hill are must-visit attractions.\n\nLouisville surprises with its bustling downtown, historic Whiskey Row, diverse neighborhoods, art galleries, and the Big Four Pedestrian Bridge, complemented by bourbon tasting and barbecue.",

        "content": "I've spent the last decadetraveling soloto all 50 states multiple times \u2014 and people often ask me for trip recommendations.\n\nMy favorite destinations are towns that have a lot to do but can sometimesfly under the radar.\n\nAlthough some on this list are still considered major cities, I find they aren't talked about nearly as often as superpopular travel destinationslike New York City or Los Angeles.\n\nHere are seven of myfavorite citiesthat I've loved visiting.\n\nColorado\u00a0Springs is often overshadowed by Nearby Denver and Boulder, but it's one of myfavorite cities to visit in Colorado.\n\nWith limitless outdoor activities, incredible access to the Rocky Mountains, and a thriving food scene, there is never a shortage of things to do in this city.\n\nI love staying at the historic Broadmoor Resort, taking the cog railway up to the summit of Pikes Peak, visiting Garden of the Gods for hiking or climbing, and heading downtown to browse the local shops and restaurants.\n\nLocated halfway between the major cities ofNashvilleand Atlanta, Chattanooga is an often-overlooked city worth the detour.\n\nThe Tennessee city is a haven for outdoor recreation, with stunning scenery for hiking, biking, kayaking, and rock climbing. It has incredible views of Lookout Mountain and its Ruby Falls, the nation's tallest underground waterfall, is a must-see.\n\nDowntown Chattanooga is lively and full of art, quaint shops, and museums. The beautiful riverfront often hosts festivals and events.\n\nSometimes overshadowed byChicagoto the north and Kansas City to the west, St. Louis is an incredible place to visit, with museums, parks, neighborhoods, sports events, and more.\n\nI love to visit the sprawling Forest Park to check out museums or rent paddle boats before heading to the St. Louis Zoo. The zoo is one of the best I've ever visited and is free to enter.\n\nOther attractions with free entrance fees include The Science Center,Gateway Arch National Park, andGrant's Farm, which is home to the Budweiser Clydesdales and over 100 animal species.\n\nTexas' flashier neighbor, Dallas, often steals the spotlight with its high-rise buildings and booming business scene.\n\nFort Worth, however, offers a more down-home Texan experience, which I prefer.\n\nThe downtown area hasSundance Square\u2014 with everything from retail stores to performing arts theaters \u2014 and museums to explore, while the Near Southside district is bustling with shops, restaurants, live music, and art.\n\nThe nearby Fort Worth Stockyards feel like traveling to a different city entirely, with cattle drives, rodeos, and honky-tonk bars scattered throughout the walkable area.\n\nSavannah sometimes gets overshadowed by other Southern cities such as Charleston andNew Orleans. Although they're similar, Savannah has its own vibe and is worth a visit.\n\nThe historic downtown is charming and hosts22 town squares, each with a unique layout and history.\n\nSpend the day eating classicSouthern food, visiting museums, exploring the hand-laid cobblestone River Street, and even heading to the beach at Tybee Island \u2014 a barrier island just 18 miles away.\n\nMany have heard of Santa Fe since it's New Mexico's state capital, but I don't think enough people are aware of how great it is to explore.\n\nThe Spanish influence is evident throughout the city's art, history, culture, and incredible food.\n\nI love to stroll the Plaza, check out Canyon Road art galleries, visit museums at Museum Hill, and indulge in New Mexican food and wine during my frequent visits.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Louisville on a recent visit to Kentucky.\n\nWith a bustling downtown and riverfront (which includes the famous Whiskey Row filled with bourbon and saloons), there is much to see and do.\n\nI loved learning about the historic neighborhoods on a walking tour, visiting art galleries, running across the Big Four Pedestrian Bridge, and, of course, enjoying whiskey tasting and barbecue.\n\nJump to"
