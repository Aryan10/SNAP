  "summary": "U.S. oil and gas operators face significant uncertainty due to recent Trump administration policy changes. Rystad Energy projects that onshore Lower 48 production will remain below November 2023's record high of 11.37 million barrels per day until at least June. The industry faces challenges from price downturns, decreased reinvestment rates, and potential economic recession risks.",
  "content": "U.S. oil and gas operators have encountered an avalanche of economic policy changes from the Trump administration over the last week, creating market uncertainty in an already maturing industry.\n\nRystad Energy expects onshore Lower 48 production will fall short of the record high output of 11.37 million barrels per day of oil, achieved in November 2023, until at least June of this year. The outlook faces serious downside pressure should the recent price downturn hold, forcing operators to cut back on rig activity.\n\nConsistent returns are top of mind for U.S. producers looking to squeeze as many dollars as possible out of their barrels. For tight oil players, decreased reinvestment rates result from fewer growth-oriented private players on the market along with their continued focus on disciplined spending and modest growth.\n\nRystad warns that existing capital frameworks will be put to the test over the coming quarters should President Trump's tariff strategy lead to an economic recession and oil demand destruction. Even prior to the price drop following the president's tariff rollout, exploration and production management teams worried about policy unpredictability.\n\nPublicly traded firms have guided plans to increase volumes by roughly 2.5 percent in 2025 while reducing spending by more than six percent. This growth, now at risk due to price collapse, is driven largely by major diversified public players and supermajors.\n\nThe EIA projects that U.S. crude oil production, including lease condensate, will average 13.51 million barrels per day in 2025 and 13.56 million barrels per day in 2026.",

Much of this growth, which is now at risk due to the collapse in prices, is driven by some of the largest diversified public players and supermajors, capable of diverting cash flows from global operations to fund more growth-oriented programs in U.S. tight oil, while still maintaining capital discipline at a corporate level,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cAlthough half-cycle breakeven prices of most wells being drilled today are in the $50 per barrel range, we estimate that public, tight oil E&Ps need more than another $9 per barrel to cover shareholder returns,\u201d it continued.\n\nRystad revealed in the release that it currently expects about 300,000 barrels per day of exit to exit growth in 2025, \u201call in the Permian - a concentration that presents another risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cPermian natural gas prices remain weak, and our projections show that dry gas production in the basin has little or no growth potential in 2025,\u201d it added.\n\nIn the release, Matthew Bernstein, Vice President of North America Oil and Gas Research at Rystad Energy, said, \u201cU.S. oil operators face both significant subsurface and above ground risks as they plan their capital investment programs\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile most oil plays are seeing deteriorating normalized productivity, U.S. producers must also compete on a global market to meet an uncertain but likely decelerating demand outlook,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRystad Energy has long maintained that presidents have very few supply-oriented policy measures at their disposal to increase U.S. oil output,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cDoing this while also bringing down prices at the same time is even more unrealistic, as producers see WTI in the $70 per barrel range as supportive of only modest growth,\u201d Bernstein went on to state.\n\nIn a report sent to Rigzone by Standard Chartered Bank Commodities Research Head Paul Horsnell late Monday, analysts at the bank, including Horsnell, said they expect U.S. oil production to weaken over the next three months.\n\nRigzone has contacted the White House, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the American Petroleum Institute for comment on Rystad\u2019s release and Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s report. At the time of writing, none of the above have responded to Rigzone.\n\nIn its latest short term energy outlook (STEO), which was released on April 10, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that U.S. crude oil production, including lease condensate, will average 13.51 million barrels per day in 2025 and 13.56 million barrels per day in 2026.\n\nLower 48 states, excluding the Gulf of America, are expected to produce 11.28 million barrels per day of the 2025 total and 11.29 million barrels per day of the 2026 total, the EIA\u2019s April STEO showed.\n\nThe Federal Gulf of America is expected to produce 1.80 million barrels per day of this year\u2019s total and 1.83 million barrels per day of next year\u2019s total, and Alaska is expected to produce 0.42 million barrels per day of the 2025 total and 0.44 million barrels per day of the 2026 total, the EIA\u2019s latest STEO highlighted.\n\nTo contact the author, emailandreas.exarheas@rigzone.com\n\nWhat do you think?
