These are on top of the previously announced tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum, which remain in place.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs will do harm to American workers and businesses, but Canada will also be impacted, with every Canadian feeling the effects. The Government of Canada\u2019s position has always been clear: we will fight these tariffs, protect our workers, and build the strongest economy in the G7.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, today announced new countermeasures to protect Canadian workers and businesses and\u00a0defend Canada\u2019s economy. These countermeasures include:\n\nMost importantly, every single dollar raised from these tariffs will go directly to support our auto workers.\n\nThese measures build on the Government of Canada\u2019s previously announced supports to Canadian workers and business, including:\n\nIn a crisis like this, it\u2019s important to come together and act with strength, purpose, and force \u2013 and that's exactly what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cThe global economy is fundamentally different today than yesterday. We must respond with purpose and force and take every step to protect Canadian workers and businesses against the unjust tariffs imposed by the United States, including on automobiles.
