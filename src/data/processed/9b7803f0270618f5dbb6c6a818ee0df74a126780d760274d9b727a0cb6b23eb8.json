Stalin on Friday (April 18, 2025) reminded Prime Minister Narendra Modi about his statements as Gujarat Chief Minister over seeking funds from the Union government. He also asked if Union Home Minister Amit Shah could guarantee that delimitation would not reduce Tamil Nadu\u2019s representation, exempt the State from the ambit of NEET, and assure that Hindi would not be imposed.\n\nDuring a government function at Ponneri in Tiruvallur district, Mr. Stalin recalledMr. Modi\u2019s commentsmade during his recent visit to Rameswaram that those in Tamil Nadu were \u201ccrying\u201d for funds, Mr. Stalin: \u201cWhat did he say? How much ever is given, those here are crying. He is saying we were crying irrespective of how much ever they give us.\u201d\n\nMr. Stalin said: \u201cWith complete humility and respect, I want to remind the Prime Minister, it was you [Mr. Modi] who said that the States were not beggars to extend hands to the Union government for funds. I am only reminding you.\u201d\n\nRecalling more statements, Mr. Stalin said: \u201cWhat did you speak while being the Gujarat Chief Minister? That they were running a parallel government through the Governors? Who said it then? Modi said it when he was the Gujarat Chief Minister. He said the Union government was partisan in allocating funds to States run by parties [that were in opposition to the Union government.\u201d\n\nTo get today\u2019s top stories from the State in your inbox, subscribe to ourTamil Nadu Today newsletter\n\nPointing out Tamil Nadu\u2019s demands to the Union government for funds, Mr. Stalin said: \u201cWhen we ask the same, how is to justified to say we are crying for funds? My asking is not crying but the right of Tamil Nadu. I am neither the one for crying nor the one who crawls and falls at someone\u2019s feet. Let us extend our hands to our relations and voice out for our rights. Who taught us this? It was our leader Kalaignar [Karunanidhi]. I am following in his footsteps.\u201d\n\nDuring his recent visit to Chennai,Union Home Minister Amit Shah claimedthat we were raising certain issues only as a diversionary tactic, Mr. Stalin recalled and further contended: \u201cWho has said this? Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Tamil Nadu is fighting for all the States in India. Is it wrong to ask for the rights of the State? Only because you did not do anything, we moved the Supreme Court against the Governor and obtained ahistoric judgment.\u201d\n\nNot only the people of Tamil Nadu but those in the rest of the country too were aware of the struggle led by the DMK, Mr. Stalin said. \u201cWhen this is the truth, those who are digressing from their path, need not lament that we are diverting. Honourable Union Home Minister Amit Shah! Can you say that Tamil Nadu would beexempted from the ambit of NEET? Can you guarantee that you would not impose Hindi? Can you list out how much funds you have sanctioned for Tamil Nadu so far?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you assure that therepresentation of Tamil Nadu would not go down after the delimitation process? If what we ask for is diversion, why have not you given a clear explanation to the people of Tamil Nadu over these?\u201d Mr. Stalin questioned.\n\nThe CM inaugurated over 6,700 projects that have been completed in Tiruvallur district at a total cost of \u20b91,166 crore. He also laid the foundation for over 7,300 new projects and launched the distribution of welfare measures to over 2.02 lakh beneficiaries.\n\nMinister S.M. Nasar; MPs S. Jagathrakshakan and Sasikanth Senthil; legislators T.J. Govindarajan, Durai Chandrasekar, S. Chandran, V.G. Raajendran, A. Krishnaswamy, K. Ganapathy, S. Sudharsanam; Tiruvallur Collector M.
