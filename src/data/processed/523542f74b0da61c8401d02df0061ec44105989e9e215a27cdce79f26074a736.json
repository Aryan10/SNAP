The woman, who recently completed her MBA, comes from a family where both parents hold government positions.\n\nHer concerns are amplified by her elder sister's ongoing struggles to find a suitable match. \"Most of the matches we've come across are from villages or hold backward mindsets,\" she reports. Despite meeting approximately 12 potential candidates through arranged setups, her sister has been unsuccessful in finding a compatible partner.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by caste considerations, with the reporter noting that her sister's current relationship faces opposition from her partner's family due to caste differences.

    "content": "I am 26 years old and have an elder sister who is 28. We come from a lower caste, and throughout my life, people have constantly reminded us of that. Because of this, I ended up hiding my caste. I was in a relationship for over four years, but things went wrong and we broke up.\n\nWe are a family of four. Both my parents work in respectable government jobs, and we now belong to the upper-middle class. However, many of our relatives still live in poverty. I completed my MBA this year, and by next month, I\u2019ll be starting a well-paying job.\n\nMy parents are struggling to find a suitable groom for my sister. Most of the matches we've come across are from villages or hold backward mindsets. She has met around 11\u201312 potential matches through arranged setups, but none have worked out. She is also in a relationship, but her boyfriend is from a different caste, and his family will not accept us.\n\nNow I\u2019m anxious about my own future. How will I find a good husband? Where should I place my hopes?\n\nHaving been in a long-term relationship, I now have a few non-negotiables in my list. But even if I compromise on those, I still worry that I won\u2019t find the right person.\n\nWhat should I do?"
