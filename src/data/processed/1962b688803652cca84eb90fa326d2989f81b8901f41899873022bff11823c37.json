  "summary": "NASA's Perseverance rover has examined 95 rocks at Mars' Jezero Crater, including five core samples, seven up-close analyses, and 83 laser-analyzed specimens. The first rim sample, \"Silver Mountain,\" dates back 3.9 billion years. The discoveries include igneous rocks, serpentine minerals, and well-preserved layered formations, exceeding scientists' expectations for geological diversity.",
  "content": "NASA's Perseverance rover is exploring the Martian rim of Jezero Crater, a crater filled with rocky outcrops.

Working withESA, NASA's Mars Sample Return Program gathers sealed samples from Mars for detailed investigation.\n\nNASA's Perseverance rover iscollectingdata on Mars as it examines rock formations that may contain evidence of the planet'sgeological history. The rover is currently traversing terrain near the rim of Jezero Crater, a basin north of the Martian equator believed to have once held a lake. After reaching the crater's western edge in December, it has been studying the stratified terrain of Witch Hazel Hill, which may offer information about past environmental conditions onMars.\n\nIn the past few months, the car-sized Perseverance has collected samples of five rocks, performed detailed analysis on seven others, and zapped an additional 83 with its laser for remote study.\n\nThe western rim of Jezero Crater contains fragmented igneous rocks that may have originated from deep below the Martian surface, likely ejected by meteor impacts. These may include the impact that formed the crater itself. Perseverance's first sample from the rim, named Silver Mountain, is estimated to be at least 3.9 billion years old, potentially from the Noachian epoch.\n\nNearby, the rover identified a boulder rich in serpentine minerals. Researchers note that such material could produce hydrogen under certain conditions, which is considered a possible energy source for microbial life. The mission team is using recent data to determine the next sampling site along the crater rim.\n\nFor the latesttech newsandreviews, follow Gadgets 360 onX,Facebook,WhatsApp,ThreadsandGoogle News.
