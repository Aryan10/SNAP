  "summary": "NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has detected SGR 0501+4516, a magnetar speeding through our galaxy. Unlike typical neutron stars, this supermagnetic object's origin remains mysterious as it doesn't align with any known supernova remnant. Scientists speculate it may have formed from a neutron star merger or white dwarf collapse.",

If one passes near Earth, it could wipe out every credit card on our planet. If you get within 600 miles, it would tear our atoms apart. Only 30 magnetars have been discovered in our Milky Way so far.\n\nFirst discovered in 2008 by NASA's Swift Observatory, SGR 0501 was seen flashing powerful gamma rays from the Milky Way's edge.
