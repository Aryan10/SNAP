  "summary": "US polypropylene export prices declined due to weak demand and high feedstock costs, making them less competitive against Asian and Middle Eastern alternatives. Chinese products have gained prominence in Latin American markets. PP homopolymer prices were assessed at USD 1015-1035/mt FAS Houston, while copolymer prices were at USD 1060-1080/mt, both dropping by USD 10/mt.",
  "content": "This week, PP export prices were assessed lower in the US. An industry source in the U.S. informed that US spot export prices for polypropylene experienced a decline in the past week, as the demand for US-sourced material remained weak, even with the recent reduction in tariff restrictions.\n\nThe high feedstock costs continued to diminish the competitiveness of US polypropylene in the international market, making it less appealing compared to more affordably priced options from Asia and the Middle East.\n\nMarket observers pointed out that China has retained a leading role in global polypropylene trade, with a notable rise in the volume of Chinese-origin products entering Latin American markets following the intensification of tariffs between the US and China. This alteration in trade dynamics has further strained US polypropylene exporters, who found it increasingly difficult to establish a foothold in a more competitive global environment.\n\nPP homopolymer prices were assessed at USD 1015-1035/mt FAS Houston while FAS Houston PP copolymer prices were assessed at USD 1060-1080/mt, both declined by USD (-10/mt) from the previous week. Upstream polymer-grade propylene spot prices were assessed at 34.00-34.50 cents/lb FOB U.S. Gulf, a gain of (+2.50 cents/lb) from last week.\n\nIn the contract markets, US propylene contract prices for March 2025 settled at the 44.00 cents/lb mark for Polymer grade propylene and 42.50 cents/lb mark for Chemical grade propylene. These prices represent a decline of 4.00 cents/lb from their February 2025 settlement levels.",
