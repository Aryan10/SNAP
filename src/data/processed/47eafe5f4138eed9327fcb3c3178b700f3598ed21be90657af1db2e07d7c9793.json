  "summary": "IndiGo airlines is expanding into the European market with planned flights to Amsterdam, challenging the existing Air India-KLM dominance on India-Netherlands routes. The carrier is reportedly partnering with Norse Atlantic Airways for aircraft capacity while awaiting its Airbus A350 deliveries.",
  "content": "IndiGo is making a strategic move into long-haul operations with its sights set on European expansion. The Indian low-cost carrier is reportedly seeking cooperation with Norse Atlantic Airways to secure the necessary aircraft capacity before its ordered Airbus A350s begin arriving.\n\nThe airline's planned Amsterdam service represents a significant step in breaking the current duopoly held by Air India and KLM on direct flights between India and the Netherlands. This expansion marks IndiGo's most ambitious international venture to date, moving beyond its traditional short and medium-haul network.\n\nThe timing of this expansion aligns with growing demand for air travel between India and Europe, as well as IndiGo's broader strategy to establish itself as a major international carrier. While waiting for its own wide-body aircraft, the partnership with Norse Atlantic Airways would allow IndiGo to enter the market sooner and begin building its presence on lucrative European routes.",
