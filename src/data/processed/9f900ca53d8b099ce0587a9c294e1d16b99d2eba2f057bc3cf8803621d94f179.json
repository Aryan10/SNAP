  "publication_date": "2023-10-20T15:17:40Z",
  "summary": "Toyota Motor is lobbying the Indian government to reduce taxes on hybrid vehicles, seeking a tax cut of up to 21% to make hybrid cars more competitive in the market. The Japanese automaker is pushing for policy changes to support hybrid technology adoption in India.",
  "content": "Toyota Motor is actively engaging with Indian authorities to reduce taxation on hybrid vehicles, according to recent developments. The Japanese automaker, which has been a strong advocate for hybrid technology, is seeking significant tax reductions that could amount to as much as 21% off current rates.\n\nThe lobbying effort comes as Toyota aims to make hybrid vehicles more accessible to Indian consumers and strengthen its position in one of the world's largest automotive markets. Currently, hybrid vehicles in India face substantial taxation that makes them considerably more expensive than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\nThe move aligns with Toyota's global strategy of promoting hybrid technology as a practical stepping stone between traditional vehicles and fully electric vehicles, particularly in markets where EV infrastructure is still developing. The company believes that hybrid technology can offer immediate environmental benefits while the ecosystem for pure electric vehicles continues to evolve.",
