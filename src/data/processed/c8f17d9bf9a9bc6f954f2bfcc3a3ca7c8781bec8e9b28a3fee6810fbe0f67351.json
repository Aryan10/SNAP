These include oily fish rich in omega-3, fruits and vegetables high in fiber, foods fortified with plant sterols and stanols, oats and barley containing beta glucan, nuts high in unsaturated fats, and soya-based products.",
  "content": "According to NHS figures, approximately 59% of people have elevated cholesterol levels, putting them at higher risk for heart problems and stroke. Heart UK explains that excessive cholesterol can accumulate in artery walls, leading to atherosclerosis.\n\nThe charity emphasizes that anyone can have high cholesterol, regardless of age, weight, or lifestyle. Since high cholesterol typically shows no symptoms, regular testing is recommended.\n\nTo combat high cholesterol, Heart UK recommends six daily food groups:\n\n1. Oily fish: Two portions weekly, providing healthy omega-3 fats. Options include salmon, sardines, pilchards, trout, herring, and mackerel.\n\n2. Fruits and vegetables: At least five portions daily, particularly high-fiber options like pulses, sweet potatoes, broccoli, apples, and strawberries.\n\n3. Foods fortified with sterols and stanols: One to three servings daily can lower cholesterol by up to 10% over three weeks.\n\n4. Oats and barley: Three servings daily provides 3g of beneficial beta glucan, which helps lower blood cholesterol.\n\n5. Nuts: 28-30g daily of varieties like almonds, walnuts, and pistachios provide healthy unsaturated fats.\n\n6. Soya foods: Two to three servings daily as a healthy replacement for high-saturated fat foods.\n\nThe experts emphasize that these foods work best when combined with a reduction in saturated fat intake and as part of an overall healthy lifestyle.",

That\u2019s because high cholesterol can be caused by different things, including your genes.\n\n\"High cholesterol is very common, but most people don't know they have it because it doesn't usually have any symptoms. That's why everyone should have acholesterol check.\"\n\nHeart UK explains when you have too much cholesterol it damages your arteries. It says: \"Fatty areas known as plaques can form, and these become harder with time, making the arteries stiffer and narrower. This process is called atherosclerosis.\n\n\"When the arteries become narrower, it\u2019s harder for blood to flow through them. This puts a strain on your heart because it has to work harder to pump blood around your body. Eventually, the heart can become weak and can\u2019t work as well as it should.\n\n\"Blood clots can form over the fatty, hardened parts of the arteries (plaques). The blood clots can block the artery completely, cutting off the blood flow. Bits of the blood clots can break away and become lodged in an artery or vein in another part of the body, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\"\n\nBut experts at Heart UK say there are things you can do to both cut your cholesterol levels now if they are already high - or reduce the chance of getting them in the future.It has drawn up a list of foodsthat can help cut high cholesterol - and set out exactly how much you should have of each every day to get the best benefit.\n\nIt says: \"There are several foods which are not just part of a healthy diet, they can actively help to lower your cholesterol too. Try to eat some of these every day as part of your healthy diet.\n\n\"The more you add them to what you eat, the more they can help lower your cholesterol, especially if you cut down onsaturated fat as well.\" This is what they recommend:\n\nCut down onsaturated fatand replace it with unsaturated fats is great way to lower your cholesterol, says the charity. Foods which containunsaturated fatsinclude:\n\nAim to eat two portions of fish per week, at least one of which should be oily.\n\nThe experts say: \"Oily fish are a good source of healthy unsaturated fats, specifically a type calledomega-3 fats.\n\n\"A portion is 140g, but you could have two or three smaller portions throughout the week. Tinned, frozen or fresh all count e.g. salmon, sardines, pilchards, trout, herring and mackerel.\"\n\nBut it warns to avoid coconut and palm oil as, unlike other vegetable oils, they are high in saturated fat.\n\nFruits and vegetables can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers. The experts explain: \"They contain vitamins, minerals and plant chemicals which help you to stay healthy, and most contain little or no fat and are low in calories, so they can help you to stay a healthy weight. And, if you are eating more fruit and veg, chances are you're eating less of the other more energy-packed foods.\n\n\"Fruit and vegetables are also high in fibre, and some types of fibre can help to lower your cholesterol. It blocks some cholesterol from being absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream.\"\n\nGood choices include pulses such as beans, peas and lentils as they are particularly high in this kind of fibre. Others include sweet potato, aubergine, okra (ladies\u2019 fingers), broccoli, apples, strawberries and prunes are also good options.\n\nFruits and vegetables can be fresh, tinned, frozen or dried. however if you opt for tinned choose those in juice or water, without added sugar or salt.\n\nHowever some fruit and vegetables are not included when it comes to getting your five-a-day. Potatoes, yams, cassava and plantains count as a starchy food, like rice or pasta.\n\nwhile unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are included but count only as one portion. The charity says: \"More than one doesn\u2019t count because the loose sugar and acid in them can damage your teeth.\"\n\nYou should aim for at least five portions of fruit and veg a day.\n\nAn adult portion is around 80g, or a handful. Make at least one of these beans, peas or lentils. Other options include:\n\nSterols and stanols are plant chemicals which are a similar size and shape to cholesterol. Heart UK explains how they work saying: \"They are absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream and block some cholesterol from being absorbed, lowering the cholesterol in your blood.\n\n\"We get a small amount of sterols from plant-based foods such as vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, but it\u2019s not enough to lower cholesterol. So, food companies have developed foods with plant sterols or stanols added to them, such as mini yogurt drinks, fat spreads, milk and yogurts.\n\n\"These fortified foods lower your cholesterol gradually, over a few weeks, and how much depends on the amount you eat. Some experts believe they are the most effective single food for lowering cholesterol.\"\n\nWhile both sterols and stanols have been thoroughly researched, so they can be added to foods and are safe to eat some people cannot have them.\n\nThey are suitable for:\n\nThey are not suitable for:\n\nAim for: one to three servings of fortified foods a day - you can get this by either:\n\nThis will give you 1.5 to 3g of stanols and sterols.Over three weeks, this could lower your cholesterol by up to 10%. There\u2019s no extra benefit to having more than 3g a day.\n\nHealth UK advises: \"To get the most from these foods, eat some every day and eat them with a meal rather than on their own. Look out for products labelled \u2018fortified with stanols or sterols\u2019. They can be branded, such as the Flora ProActiv and Benecol ranges, as well as supermarket own products.\"\n\nOats and barley are grains which are rich in a type of fibre called beta glucan. The experts say: \"Eating 3g of beta-glucan a day as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle can help to lower cholesterol.\n\n\"When you eat beta glucan, it forms a gel which binds to cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestines. This helps limit the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed from the gut into your blood. Your liver then has to take more cholesterol out of your blood to make more bile, which lowers your blood cholesterol.\"\n\nAim for: three servings of the following oat-based products or barley per day to give you about 3g of beta glucans.\n\nThe charity added: \"Many products now contain oats, which makes it easier to get your two to four servings. Foods which have a claim on the label saying they lower cholesterol will contain 1g or more of beta glucan.\"\n\nNuts are a good source ofunsaturated fatsand are lower insaturated fats, a mix which can help to keep your cholesterol in check. Heart UK says: \"They contain fibre which can help block some cholesterol being absorbed into the blood stream from the gut, as well as protein, vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, natural plantsterolsand other plant nutrients which help keep your body healthy. They\u2019re also filling, so you\u2019re less likely to snack on other things.\n\nAim for: 28-30g of nuts a day, which is around a handful.\n\nIt adds: \"All nuts count. Choose a variety and eat them instead of your normal snack or as part of a meal. Where possible, go for the kind with their skins still intact as they contain more nutrients.\"\n\nGood options are:\n\nSoya beans and the foods that are made from them are perfect for a heart-healthy diet, advises Heart UK. \"They\u2019re full of protein, vitamins and minerals, and they're low in saturated fat. Soya products are a good option for replacing foods which are high in saturated fat such as meat, full fat cream and dairy products, and snacks such as crisps.\"\n\nAim for: around two to three servings of soya a foods day.\n\nOne serving is:"
