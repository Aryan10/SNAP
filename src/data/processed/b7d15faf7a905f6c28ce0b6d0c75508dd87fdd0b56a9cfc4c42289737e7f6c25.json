The manufacturers argue that implementing direct TV signal reception would require significant hardware modifications, including additional antennas that could affect the form factor of modern smartphones.\n\nThe government's proposal aims to make television content more accessible to the Indian population, particularly in areas with limited internet connectivity. However, smartphone OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) fear that such requirements could create complications for their global supply chains and potentially make devices more expensive for consumers.",
