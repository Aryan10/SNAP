  "content": "The Bank of Canada has issued a stark warning about the economic outlook for the country, predicting that continued trade tensions with the United States could push Canada toward a severe economic downturn.\n\nThe central bank's analysis indicates that the combination of US tariffs and escalating trade war measures are creating significant headwinds for the Canadian economy. Key export sectors including steel, aluminum, and automotive industries have been particularly affected by the trade restrictions.\n\nAccording to the bank's projections, if current trade tensions persist or escalate further, Canada could face its most serious economic challenge since the 2008 financial crisis. The bank estimates that continued trade disruptions could reduce Canadian GDP growth by up to 2% over the next two years.\n\nThe report also highlights concerns about declining business investment and consumer confidence as uncertainty around trade relations continues to affect economic decision-making across the country.",
