Why John Cena must break hearts at WrestleMania 41.\n\nIt feels like only yesterday that Cody Rhodes was \"finishing the story\" and beating Roman Reigns to finally becomeWWEChampion at WrestleMania 40. One year on, WWE has littered the 'Mania 41 lineup with a few puzzling choices, but most fans will leave the weekend remembering the biggest stories. Some questions need to be answered: Will John Cena become a 17-time World Champ? Will The Rock actually turn up? Is Paul Heyman turning on Roman Reigns?\n\nOther choices facing Triple H include thrashing out who leaves with both major Women's Titles, and whether or not he's all in on Jey Uso's quest to dethrone Gunther. As always, and despite some of the painfully obvious excuses to squeeze as many wrestlers as humanly possible onto the undercard,WrestleMania will be some spectacle.\n\nFans should prepare themselves for huge title changes, at least a handful of shocks that leave everyone's thumbs blistered from gleefully gushing and/or ranting on social apps, and the usual pomp and circumstance people have come to expect when WWE spares no expense. The pyro budget alone could've keptECWin business.\n\nOne thing to note: You absolutely willnotagree with everything here, but a lot of thought has gone into it. It's important to look at what happens after 'Mania 41, not just the Saturday and Sunday nights themselves. Hunter will be eager to avoid typical post-supershow lulls, especially withPPVs/PLEs like Backlash and then SummerSlam looming.\n\nHere's absolutely everything that needs to happen when WWE lands in Las Vegas.\n\nFirst up, a nifty surprise that leaves Judgment Day in tatters.\n\nPretty much everyone would've been expecting to see either Bron Breakker or Penta's name stuck in as the winner here, but...nope. 'Dirty' Dominik Mysterio scooping some shockIntercontinental Titleglory would be one hell of a way to stick a fork in his stable and send Finn B\u00e1lor into meltdown. WWE could always shove the belt back on Bron on the Raw after 'Mania if they so wished.\n\nMysterio is a heat-seeking missile though, and it's clear there's been trouble in paradise between Judgment Day members for a while. The faction is a shadow of its former self anyway, so it's definitely time to move everyone on to other things. Creative won't do that without booking some easy matches between fractured friends though - Dominik vs. Finn is one of those.\n\nThe beauty of this multi-man scenario is that Breakker can drop the IC belt without being pinned or submitted. That might sound like a bit of a cop out, but there's no need to beat himor Pentain Las Vegas when the in-fighting between JD members is right there staring everyone in the face.\n\nIt'd be a lot of fun if 'Dirty' Dom Dom got a short reign with main roster singles gold just to tick B\u00e1lor off. Then, if need be, Bron can go spear crazy on everybody post-match (like he has on episodes of Raw recently) and stop Finn from getting his hands on a so-called stablemate who just pinned him. Everyone's a winner, at least longer term.\n\nLifelong wrestling, video game, music and sports obsessive who has been writing about his passions since childhood.
