Raising safety concerns, he added, \u201cWhen I reached that classroom, I found that there was just one entry and exit. There should have been two. It is mandatory for portacabins, as per UGC rules. This lays the ground for FIR, my legal team is ready to take action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe students have complained one after another\u2026 Students of that college are distressed\u2026 I want to convey a message to the Ministry of Education that in these times, there is a dire need for there to be ACs in classrooms, these are mandatory for portacabins. The quicker the Government understands this, students will be able to study better,\u201d Khatri said, announcing plans to file an FIR and take the matter to the High Court, alleging that the principal had violated rules.\n\nDefending her action, Principal Vatsala told PTI on April 13 that the cow dung plastering was part of an ongoing study to examine heat-reducing properties of natural materials. \u201cIt is under process. I will be able to share details of the full research after a week,\u201d she said. She added that misinformation was being spread, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in touching natural mud.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to ANI, the principal said, \u201cYes, discussions were held with students\u2026 I wasn\u2019t here. Someone texted me on WhatsApp that Ronak Khatri was coming to me but I had a pre-scheduled programme\u2026 I wasn\u2019t here when he reached\u2026 Sometimes, students do something out of zeal.

There are fans. We were sitting with EVS faculty to find out some local solutions\u2026 So, we started a study to control heat stress. Researches have been done on cow dung earlier as well. So, in that background, since there was no plaster in portacabins and it is located on the second floor, we thought of preparing something with cow dung by mixing it with mud to see the cooling effect,\u201d she said.\n\n#WATCH| Principal of Delhi University\u2019s Lakshmibai College, Pratyush Vatsala says, \"Those are portacabins in the canteen block, on the second floor...A few classes are held there as last option.

I thought I, too, should join in\u2026 So I went ahead. I shared it with our internal faculty group. I wrote that these are some \u2018desi\u2019 efforts to ensure that there is some comfort in those rooms. I can\u2019t say who shared it from the faculty group and with what intention.\u201d\n\nAccording to PTI, the administration maintained that the method is part of scientific inquiry into sustainable practices amid rising temperatures in the capital.\n\nWe use cookies to improve your experience, analyze traffic, and personalize content.
