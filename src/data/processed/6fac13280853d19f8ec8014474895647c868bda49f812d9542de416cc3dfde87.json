  "summary": "Researchers at Fudan University have created a revolutionary non-volatile flash memory called \"PoX\" that can program a single bit in 400 picoseconds, making it 10,000 times faster than current technology. The device combines graphene channels with AI-driven optimization to achieve unprecedented speed while maintaining data retention without power.",

The result, published today in Nature, pushes non\u2011volatile memory to a speed domain previously reserved for the quickest volatile memories and sets a benchmark for data\u2011hungry AI hardware.\n\nConventional static and dynamic RAM (SRAM, DRAM) write data in 1\u201310 nanoseconds but lose everything when power is cut. Flash chips, by contrast, hold data without power yet typically need micro\u2011 to milliseconds per write \u2014 far too slow formodern AIaccelerators that shunt terabytes of parameters in real time.\n\nThe Fudan group, led by Prof. Zhou Peng at the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Chips and Systems, re\u2011engineered flash physics by replacing silicon channels with two\u2011dimensional Dirac graphene and exploiting its ballistic charge transport.\n\nBy tuning the \u201cGaussian length\u201d of the channel, the team achieved two\u2011dimensional super\u2011injection, which is an effectively limitless charge surge into the storage layer that bypasses the classical injection bottleneck.\n\n\u201cUsing AI\u2011driven process optimization, we drove non\u2011volatile memory to its theoretical limit,\u201d Zhou told Xinhua, adding that the feat \u201cpaves the way for future high\u2011speed flash memory.\u201d\n\nCo\u2011author Liu Chunsen likens the breakthrough to shifting from a U\u2011disk that writes 1,000 times per second to a chip that fires 1 billion times in the blink of an eye. The previous world record for non\u2011volatile flash programming speed was about two million operations per second.\n\nBecause PoX is non\u2011volatile, it retains data with no standby power, a critical property for next\u2011generation edge AI andbattery\u2011constrained systems. Combining ultra\u2011low energy with picosecond write speeds could remove the long\u2011standing memory bottleneck in AI inference and training hardware, where data shuttling, not arithmetic, now dominates power budgets.\n\nFlash memory remains a cornerstone of global semiconductor strategy thanks to its cost and scalability. Fudan\u2019s advance, reviewers say, offers a \u201ccompletely original mechanism\u201d that may disrupt that landscape.\n\nIf mass\u2011produced, PoX\u2011style memory could eliminate separate high\u2011speed SRAM caches in AI chips, slashing area and energy. It can enable instant\u2011on, low\u2011powerlaptopsand phones, and support database engines that hold entire working sets in persistent RAM.\n\nThe device can also strengthen China\u2019s domestic drive to secure leadership in foundationalchip technologies. The team did not disclose endurance figures or fabrication yield, but the graphene channel suggests compatibility with existing 2D\u2011material processes that global fabs are already exploring. \u201cOur breakthrough can reshape storage technology, drive industrial upgrades and open new application scenarios,\u201d Zhou said.\n\nFudan engineers are now scaling the cell architecture and pursuing array\u2011level demonstrations. Commercial partners have not been named, but Chinese foundries are racing to integrate 2D materials with mainstream CMOS lines.\n\nIf successful, PoX could come in as a new class of ultra\u2011fast, ultra\u2011green memories that meet the swelling appetite of large\u2011language\u2011model accelerators, finally giving AI hardware a storage medium that keeps pace with its logic.\n\nKaif ShaikhKaif Shaikh is a journalist and writer passionate about turning complex information into clear, impactful stories.
