Big Progress!\" President Trump posted on social media.\n\nA photo of Japan's lead trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa and Donald Trump at the White House was posted on X shortly after the meeting.(X: The White House)\n\nWhile Asia's major exporters to the US, including Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan open discussions with the Trump administration on tariffs, China is notably absent from the offices of the White House.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, he posted on social media that China \"wants to meet!\", despite Beijing showing no signs it wants to negotiate.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinpinghas spent the week in South-East Asia, trying to rally support from neighbouring countries amid the tariff war.\n\nPresident Xi arrived in Cambodia on Thursday and said Cambodia should oppose \"hegemonism\" and \"protectionism\", echoing similar sentiments expressed in Malaysia and Vietnam earlier in the week.\n\nThe US has said it was up to China to start negotiations, but that did not look likely.\n\n\"The unilateral tariff increases were entirely initiated by the United States,\" He Yongqian, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson, told a weekly news conference.\n\nMs He, quoting an old Chinese proverb said, \"the person who tied the bell must be the one who unties it\".\n\nWhile the trade war continues between the US and China, here's what we know about other countries at the negotiating table with the Trump administration.\n\nJapanese negotiatorRyosei Akazawa met President Trump, Mr Greer and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Washington on Wednesday, US time, with no detailed

the highest priority to negotiations with Japan,\" Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said, adding that he was ready to meet President Trump himself.\n\nJapan's car industry is heavily reliant on the

United States last year.\n\nJapan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato told Reuters he was \"deeply concerned\" about the global economic fall-out from the tariff chaos, saying they could have significant impacts on the country's economy.\n\nVietnam didn't wait for President Trump to announce a 90-day pause on tariffs above 10 per cent to start discussions.\n\nThe timing of his tour through South-East Asia couldn't be better for Xi, who is trying to court as many countries as possible to form a united diplomatic front against Trump's tariffs.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc had already been in Washington for several days before the start of the pause, meeting US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.\n\nThreatened with additional import duties of 46 per cent, Hanoi said it wanted to buy more US products, including defence equipment.\n\nThe South-East Asian manufacturing powerhouse has the fourth-largest trade surplus with the United States, coming in at $123.5 billion ($193b) in 2024.\n\nTo reach a compromise, Hanoi may have to overcome Washington's suspicion that Vietnam is helping China circumvent US tariffs.\n\nTaiwan said it held an initial video conference with US officials on April 11.\n\nPresident Lai Ching-te said the island, which hopes to protect its exporters from tariffs of up to 35 per cent, was \"on the US government's first negotiation list\".\n\nAfter the Trump administration exempted smartphones and semiconductors from tariffs, the president backtracked and warned no one was \"getting off the hook\".\n\nWashington is the main guarantor of Taiwan's security in the face of China, which claims the island democracy as its own.\n\nPresident Trump has not hesitated to link Washington's security relations with Taipei to the trade issue.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of Taiwan's exports to the United States are tech products, such as semiconductors.\n\nUnder pressure, top Taiwanese chip maker TSMC has unveiled plans to invest a further $US100 billion ($156 billion) in the United States.\n\n\"We will strive for a fair and competitive tariff for our industry,\" Taiwan's Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said this week.\n\nSeoul has announced billions in dollars of aid for its semiconductor and automobile companies as a buffer against the tariffs.\n\nHowever, South Korea is also counting on talks, with Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok set to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent next week.\n\nKim Dae-jong, an economics expert at South Korea's Sejong University, said Seoul would need to \"expand trade centred on the US and reduce our reliance on exports to China to less than half of current levels\" to try and appease the Trump administration.\n\nIndonesia's Economy Minister Airlangga Hartarto is leading a week-long trade delegation to the United States that started on Wednesday.\n\nChinese factories are trying to sell directly to American consumers on social media platforms in a bid to bypass the 145 per cent tariff hike imposed by Donald Trump.\n\nJakarta, which is threatened with 32 per cent duties, plans to boost purchases of US products such as hydrocarbons to reduce its $17.9 billion ($28.3b) surplus with Washington.\n\nThailand's Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira is travelling to Washington from Thursday, with Bangkok poised to commit to buying more US agricultural and energy products.\n\nThai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Thursday that Bangkok has \"strong offers\" that Mr Chunhavajira will raise during negotiations on April 23.\n\nSingapore's Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, said he spoke with Mr Greer, the US trade representative, on April 15 to explain the city-state's \"unique status as a small open economy\".\n\n\"We just have to explain this and continue to explain this, and hopefully the US will better understand our situation,\" Mr Gan said. \"We do have a trade deficit with the US.\"\n\nIn Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Canberra had made a proposal to the United States.\n\n\"We'll engage diplomatically,\" he said during theABC leaders debatewith opposition leader Peter Dutton.\n\nHe vowed to defend Australia's national interests
