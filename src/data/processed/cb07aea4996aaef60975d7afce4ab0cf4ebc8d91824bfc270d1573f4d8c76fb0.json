  "summary": "Following Infosys' disappointing fourth quarter earnings report, multiple brokerages have reduced their target prices for the company by 9-13%. The news has impacted market sentiment around one of India's leading IT services companies.",
  "content": "Financial analysts and brokerages have responded to Infosys' weak Q4 performance by significantly reducing their target prices for the company's stock. The downward revision, ranging between 9% to 13%, reflects growing concerns about the company's near-term growth prospects.\n\nThe development comes as India's second-largest IT services provider faces challenges in the global market. The stock price adjustments by brokerages indicate a shifting market perception of Infosys' valuation in light of its recent financial performance.\n\nThe news has drawn attention from investors and market watchers, particularly given Infosys' position as one of the benchmark stocks in Indian markets and its significance in the technology sector.",
