        "content": "Daijiworld Media Network- Pretoria\n\nPretoria, Apr 17:Amid a noticeable uptick in malaria cases, South Africa's Department of Health has issued a stern call for heightened vigilance, particularly in provinces known to be endemic to the disease, including Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nThe department, in a statement released on Wednesday and cited by Xinhua news agency, also flagged the growing malaria threat in neighbouring Southern African Development Community (SADC) nations such as Botswana, Eswatini, Namibia, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. This, authorities warned, poses a risk of cross-border transmission, especially during the Easter holiday period when travel for cultural and religious observances spikes.\n\nFoster Mohale, spokesperson for the health department, cautioned, \u201cAs people move across borders during this season, we are on high alert for any sudden surges in local transmission. This preventable disease continues to pose a serious public health risk.\u201d\n\nHealthcare workers across both endemic and non-endemic regions have been instructed to maintain a high level of suspicion when treating patients with flu-like symptoms. Mohale stressed the importance of quick identification and reporting of malaria cases to facilitate timely response efforts.\n\n\u201cIn addition to prompt testing, we\u2019re urging health workers to thoroughly probe patients\u2019 travel history, particularly from malaria-prone areas. If symptoms persist despite an initial negative result, repeat testing is vital,\u201d he added.\n\nThe department reiterated that early diagnosis and immediate treatment are crucial in saving lives and halting further spread. Malaria is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Common symptoms to watch for include fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite.\n\n\u201cWith the Easter holidays prompting significant travel, we advise all travellers heading to or through high-risk zones to take precautionary anti-malaria medication such as doxycycline, which is freely available at public health facilities,\u201d the department advised.\n\nAnyone experiencing symptoms consistent with malaria is urged to seek medical care without delay and disclose any recent travel history to health professionals.\n\n\u201cRemaining alert and taking preventative steps can go a long way in curbing the spread of this disease,\u201d Mohale concluded.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nPlease write your correct name and email address.
