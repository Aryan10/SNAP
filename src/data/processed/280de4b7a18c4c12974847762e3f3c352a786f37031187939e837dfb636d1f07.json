Connect with us for all things health.\n\nNew research from Sweden suggests that starting a second cholesterol-lowering drug soon after a heart attack may help save lives.\n\nAccording to the study, published in the April 2025 issue of theJournal of the American College of Cardiology, people who receivedezetimibe (brand name Zetia)with their statin therapy within 12 weeks of a heart attack had fewer heart-related complications and deaths than those who waited longer or never added ezetimibe at all.\n\nTheNational Library of Medicineexplains that ezetimibe helps reduce the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in your blood by preventing cholesterol from being absorbed in the small intestine.\n\nLDL cholesterolis the so-called \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol associated with clogged arteries and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such asheart attackandstroke.\n\nEzetimibe is sometimes prescribed for people who can\u2019t tolerate statins. It may also be used as an add-on treatment when statins do not sufficiently lower cholesterol.\n\nThis medication works differently fromstatins, which exert their cholesterol-lowering effects by slowing down the liver\u2019s production of the waxy substance.\n\nTo arrive at their conclusion, the researchers analyzed data from more than 35,000 patients hospitalized forheart attacks (myocardial infarction)between 2015 and 2022, using the comprehensive SWEDEHEART registry in Sweden.\n\nMost patients were prescribed high-intensity statins at discharge, but a subset also began taking a second medication, ezetimibe, within the first 12 weeks after discharge.\n\nThe study categorized patients into three groups: those who started ezetimibe early (within 12 weeks), those who started late (13 weeks to 16 months after discharge), and those who never received ezetimibe during this period.\n\nImportantly, the analysis used advanced statistical methods \u2014 specifically, a clone-censor-weight framework \u2014 to emulate a randomized clinical trial and minimize biases\n\nResults showed that patients who started ezetimibe early in combination with statins had a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which include death, another heart attack, or stroke, compared to those who delayed ezetimibe or never took it.\n\nOne-year incidence rates of MACE were 1.79 per 100 patient-years in the early ezetimibe group, compared with 2.58 in the late group and 4.03 in those without ezetimibe.\n\nAt three years, the hazard ratio for MACE was 1.14 for late versus early treatment (not statistically significant) but was 1.29 for no ezetimibe versus early treatment, indicating substantially higher risk without ezetimibe.\n\nCardiovascular death was also significantly higher in the late and no ezetimibe groups compared to early treatment.\n\nAdditionally, early combination therapy led to a greater proportion of patients achieving guideline-recommended LDL cholesterol targets (<1.4 mmol/L or <55 mg/dL) within one year.\n\nThe study underscores that a stepwise approach \u2014 starting with statins and adding ezetimibe only if LDL cholesterol goals are not met \u2014 inevitably delays optimal cholesterol lowering and is associated with avoidable harm.\n\nAs the authors note, approximately 75\u201380% of post-heart attack patients fail to reach LDL goals with statin therapy alone; initiating combination therapy early can improve outcomes and reduce future cardiovascular events.\n\nTo maximize protection, the researchers advocate that care pathways for heart attack patients should be updated to implement early combination therapy with statins and ezetimibe as standard care, potentially even before hospital discharge.\n\nArun Manmadhan, MD, assistant professor of cardiology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who was not involved with the study, said the findings align with a broader body of research showing that sustained, low LDL cholesterol levels are associated with fewer heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\u201cThis is even more important in people who have already experienced one of these events,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause lowering the cholesterol levels, in addition to optimizing other cardiac risk factors, is one of the most effective and proven ways to prevent a second event.\u201d\n\nManmadhan said that, in his opinion, this study adds to the evidence that patients who have had a heart attack or stroke should have their cholesterol levels aggressively managed, both through lifestyle and medications.\n\n\u201cThis study suggests that time is also an important factor,\u201d he added. \u201c[The] earlier and faster cholesterol levels are aggressively controlled to recommended levels after a heart attack, the better it is for preventing future cardiovascular events.\u201d\n\nMarkyia Nichols, MD, MPH, RDN, a CDC-certified lifestyle coach and chief medical officer at Ciba Health, said patients should know that \u201ccholesterol isn\u2019t the enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a response,\u201d she explained. \u201cCholesterol is essential for life. It builds hormones, stabilizes cells, and repairs tissue. If cholesterol is rising, it\u2019s critical to ask what the body is trying to repair or protect against.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nichols, inflammation is the real problem, not cholesterol. A diet high in sugar, processed seed oils, and ultra-processed foods, insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction, chronic stress, and exposure to toxins can all factor into creating inflammation.\n\n\u201cOnce the heart lining is damaged, the body sends cholesterol as a patch,\u201d she said. \u201cCholesterol doesn\u2019t cause the \u2018fire.\u2019 It acts more like the \u2018firefighters.'\u201d\n\nNichols added that, digging deeper, LDL only becomes dangerous when it\u2019s oxidized due to poor nutrition.\n\nCircling back to the study, she told Healthline that while adding ezetimibe to statins post-early heart attack may lower cholesterol, it\u2019s not addressing the root causes of the problem. Patients also need to focus on nutrition.\n\n\u201cAsk for labwork that tests levels of magnesium, omega-3s, vitamin D, and vitamin K2,\u201d she advised. \u201cYou can\u2019t rebuild a healthy heart without healthy raw materials.\u201d\n\nShe also suggests looking to see whether your markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and insulin, are high.\n\nFurther, look for any sources of inflammation you might have, like a poor diet, stress, toxins, or an unhealthy gut.\n\nNichols concluded by saying that you may need to see a board-certified doctor trained in root-cause medicine to determine what\u2019s causing your inflammation.\n\nHowever, addressing this can help you heal the underlying causes of your high cholesterol.\n\nShare this article\n\nA new study suggests that certain cardiovascular risk factors could significantly impact females more than males.
