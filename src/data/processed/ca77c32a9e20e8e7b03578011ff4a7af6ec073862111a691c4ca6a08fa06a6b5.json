        "content": "Every week it seems there\u2019s a new diet or protein-enriched snack to try. UVA nutritionist Melanie Brede offers tips to make sure you meet your nutritional needs. (Illustration by John DiJulio, University Communications)\n\nNew protein-enriched products are hitting grocery store shelves and being advertised seemingly every day, while diets prioritizing protein make the rounds on social media.\n\nWith this influx of products, plus sometimes contradictory nutritional advice, it may be hard to know whether you\u2019re meeting your nutritional needs. That\u2019s why UVA Today talked to Melanie Brede, a senior nutritionist at the University of Virginia\u2019s Student Health and Wellness Center, to learn the truth about protein.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance for a \u201cbasically healthy individual,\u201d is about a gram of protein for every two pounds of body weight, or 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, Brede said. A person who weighs 160 pounds, for example, would need to eat about 80 grams of protein per day.\n\nBrede teaches clients to use their hands to estimate portion sizes. For example, a hamburger about the size of someone\u2019s palm is four or five ounces of beef, which adds up to about 40 grams of protein, with each ounce providing eight grams.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s half your protein needs in one day right there,\u201d Brede says.\n\nPlant-based sources of protein, like beans and nuts, need to double in quantity to get a similar amount of protein.\n\nBrede says while it may be boring, the advice to eat three meals a day, plus snacks, is tried and true. (Contributed photo)\n\nFor most people, the answer is no. Typical forms of exercise, like walking the dog or light aerobics, don\u2019t dramatically increase a person\u2019s protein needs.\n\nEndurance athletes training for events like a marathon probably need to up their protein to 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein for every 2.2 pounds of body weight. Strength athletes \u2013 like bodybuilders \u2013 should get about 2 grams of protein for every 2.2 pounds of body weight. But that may be temporary.\n\n\u201cOur bodies get more efficient at using protein and building muscle as we increase our fitness, so it\u2019s believed that we most need that extra protein when exercise is new,\u201d Brede said.\n\nUsually, it\u2019s relatively easy for people to meet their protein needs even with a new workout routine, because they\u2019ll also be eating more calories to fuel those workouts.\n\nGood news for vegans and vegetarians: There are lots of good non-meat protein sources, Brede said, such as nuts, beans, eggs and soy products like tofu. Even grain products like bread, rice and pasta contain protein.\n\n\u201cEven in carrots and broccoli and peppers, you can find a little bit of protein,\u201d Brede said.\n\nVegans and vegetarians often need to eat a larger volume of food \u2013 not just to meet their protein needs, but also to ensure they\u2019re consuming enough calories overall.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re building something, you probably need a little more protein,\u201d Brede said.\n\nThat applies to building muscle, but also the growth of new cells during pregnancy.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that women in menopause should slightly increase their protein. Brede added that as people age, regardless of gender, it\u2019s important to make sure they get their protein in \u201cdoses\u201d throughout the day.\n\nBrede uses an analogy of building a wall. You might have all the bricks you need, but if someone asks you to build a wall in a minute, you won\u2019t succeed. Protein works similarly \u2013 you might meet all your daily needs in one meal, but your body can\u2019t use it as efficiently to build muscle. Instead, it might get stored or burned as energy.\n\n\u201cIt might sound like boring advice, but you should get three meals a day and some snacks,\u201d Brede said.\n\nProtein bars, powders and shakes are seemingly everywhere. And they can certainly be a convenient way to get protein, Brede said.\n\n\u201cMost often, those products are using whey protein, which is a protein in milk, or they use a pea protein or a soy protein,\u201d Brede said. \u201cThey had to start with food.\u201d\n\nWhen you opt for a protein bar over some scrambled eggs, you trade the nutritional benefits of \u201cwhole foods\u201d for convenience, Brede said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always going to focus on a food-first approach,\u201d Brede said.\n\nAlice Berry\n\nUniversity News AssociateOffice of University Communications\n\naberry@virginia.edu434-924-6861\n\nApril 19, 2025"
